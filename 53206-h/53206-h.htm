<h4>PREFATORY NOTE</h4>


<p>No Poet represented in this book was over fifty when, in 1919, I began
to compile it. The eldest of them all was born in 1870.</p>

<p>Many good and some great living poets are therefore missing from its
pages. Nothing is here by Mr Hardy or Mr Bridges, by Mr A. E. Housman,
Mr Yeats, <i>Æ,</i> Mr Binyon, Mr Hewlett, Mr Herbert Trench, Mr Gosse, Mr
Austin Dobson, Mr Doughty, Mr Kipling, Sir Henry Newbolt, Mrs Meynell,
Mrs Woods, Mr Wilfrid Blunt, and others whose names must appear in
any comprehensive anthology from living poets. The date, 1870, was
arbitrarily chosen: so would any other date have been. But some date I
had to fix, for my object was to illustrate what many of us think an
exceptional recent flowering.</p>

<p>I do not propose to analyse the tendencies, in idea and in method,
exhibited in the poems here collected. These things are always
better seen at a distance; and anyhow the materials are here for
the production of an analysis by the reader himself, if he is eager
for one. But I will express one opinion, and call attention to one
phenomenon. The opinion is that the majority of the poems in this book
have merit and that many more could have been printed without lowering
the standard. And the phenomenon is the simultaneous appearance&mdash;the
result of underlying currents of thought and feeling&mdash;of a very large
number of poets who write only or mainly in lyrical forms. Several
living poets of the highest repute have won their reputation solely on
short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> poems, and there are, and have been, a very large number indeed
who have written one or two good poems.</p>

<p>The better production of our generation has been mainly lyrical and
it has been widely diffused. Where is the ambitious work on a large
scale? Where is the twentieth century poet who is fulfilling the usual
functions of the greatest poets: to display human life in all its range
and variety, or to exercise a clear and powerful influence on the
thought of mankind with regard to the main problems of our existence?
These questions are asked; possibly Echo may give its traditional and
ironic answer.</p>

<p>There are several observations, however, which should be made. One is
that the great doctrinal poets have not always become widely recognised
as such in their own prime, their general vogue being posthumous.
Another is that we cannot possibly tell what a poet now living and
young may or may not do before he dies. But though I have my own views
on this subject I do not think that the age, even if admitted to be
purely lyrical, stands in need of defence. It is of no use asking a
poetical renascence to conform to type, for there isn't any type.
There are marked differences in the features of all those English
poetical movements which have chiefly contributed to the body of our
"immortal" poetry. In the Elizabethan age we had the greatest diversity
of production: a multitude of great and small men, with much genius,
or but a spark of it blown to life by the favourable wind, produced
works in every form and on every scale. The age of Herbert and Vaughan,
of Crashaw, Herrick, Marvell, Carew, Suckling, Lovelace, Corbet,
Habington, is memorable almost solely for its lyrical work. The era
of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, and Keats was an age during
which a vast amount of great poetry was written by a few great poets;
there was very little healthy undergrowth. Should our literary age be
remembered by posterity solely as an age during which fifty men had
written lyrics of some durability for their truth and beauty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> it would
not be remembered with contempt. It is in that conviction that I have
compiled this anthology.</p>

<p>It is irritating to feel that even within its own limits it does
not appear to myself&mdash;not to mention others&mdash;as good or as nearly
representative as it might have been. Permission could not be obtained
to print Mr Masefield's <i>Biography</i> and his <i>August 1914,</i> which I
personally happen to prefer to any of his shorter works. Since the time
in 1919-20 when I was compiling the book two volumes have come out from
which I should like to have made large seleetions: Edmund Blunden's
<i>The Waggoner</i> and the late Wilfrid Owen's <i>Poems.</i> Each of these poets
is inadequately represented here; and a few things by others, who do
not appear here at all, came to my notice when it was too late to put
them in.</p>

<p>I have to thank the living poets from whose works I have drawn for
permitting me to use everything I wanted. I am grateful to Mrs
Brooke and Rupert Brooke's literary executor, Mr Edward Marsh (whose
"Georgian" collections have been a great stimulus and help to me) for
permission to use a selection from Brooke; to Mrs J. E. Flecker for
poems by her husband; to Lady Desborough for the poems by her son,
Julian Grenfell; to Lord Dunsany for the poems by Francis Ledwidge; to
Mrs Thomas Macdonagh and Mrs Joseph Plunkett for the poems by their
husbands; to Mrs Owen for her son Wilfrid Owen's <i>Strange Meeting;</i>
to Professor W. R. Sorley for the poems by his son, Charles Sorley;
to Lady Glenconner for those by her son, Edward Wyndham Tennant; to
Mrs Edward Thomas for the poems (published too late for him ever to
know-how people would admire them) by Edward Thomas.</p>

<p>Finally, almost every publisher in the kingdom has assisted the book
with permission to reprint copyright poems. The full list of publishers
and works is as follows: Messrs Bell (Edward L. Davison, <i>Poems</i>);

MARRIAGE SONG<br />
<br />
<br />
Come up, dear chosen morning, come,<br />
Blessing the air with light,<br />
And bid the sky repent of being dark:<br />
Let all the spaces round the world be white,<br />
And give the earth her green again.<br />
Into new hours of beautiful delight,<br />
Out of the shadow where she has lain,<br />
Bring the earth awake for glee,<br />
Shining with dews as fresh and clear<br />
As my beloved's voice upon the air.<br />
For now, O morning chosen of all days, on thee<br />
A wondrous duty lies:<br />
There was an evening that did loveliness foretell;<br />
Thence upon thee, O chosen morn, it fell<br />
To fashion into perfect destiny<br />
The radiant prophecy.<br />
For in an evening of young moon, that went<br />
Filling the moist air with a rosy fire,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>I and my beloved knew our love;<br />
And knew that thou, O morning, wouldst arise<br />
To give us knowledge of achieved desire.<br />
For, standing stricken with astonishment,<br />
Half terrified in the delight,<br />
Even as the moon did into clear air move<br />
And made a golden light,<br />
Lo there, croucht up against it, a dark hill,<br />
A monstrous back of earth, a spine<br />
Of hunchèd rock, furred with great growth of pine,<br />
Lay like a beast, snout in its paws, asleep;<br />
Yet in its sleeping seemed it miserable,<br />
As though strong fear must always keep<br />
Hold of its heart, and drive its blood in dream.<br />
Yea, for to our new love, did it not seem,<br />
That dark and quiet length of hill,<br />
The sleeping grief of the world?&mdash;Out of it we<br />
Had like imaginations stept to be<br />
Beauty and golden wonder; and for the lovely fear<br />
Of coming perfect joy, had changed<br />
The terror that dreamt there I<br />
And now the golden moon had turned<br />
To shining white, white as our souls that burned<br />
With vision of our prophecy assured:<br />
Suddenly white was the moon; but she<br />
At once did on a woven modesty<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>Of cloud, and soon went in obscured:<br />
And we were dark, and vanisht that strange hill.<br />
But yet it was not long before<br />
There opened in the sky a narrow door,<br />
Made with pearl lintel and pearl sill;<br />
And the earth's night seem'd pressing there,&mdash;<br />
All as a beggar on some festival would peer,&mdash;<br />
To gaze into a room of light beyond,<br />
The hidden silver splendour of the moon.<br />
Yea, and we also, we<br />
Long gazed wistfully<br />
Towards thee, O morning, come at last,<br />
And towards the light that thou wilt pour upon us soon!<br />
<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
O soul who still art strange to sense,<br />
Who often against beauty wouldst complain,<br />
Doubting between joy and pain<br />
If like the startling touch of something keen<br />
Against thee, it hath been<br />
To follow from an upland height<br />
The swift sun hunting rain<br />
Across the April meadows of a plain,<br />
Until the fields would flash into the air<br />
Their joyous green, like emeralds alight<br />
Or when in the blue of night's mid-noon<br />
The burning naked moon<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Draws to a brink of cloudy weather near,<br />
A breadth of snow, firm and soft as a wing,<br />
Stretcht out over a wind that gently goes,&mdash;<br />
Through the white sleep of snowy cloud there grows<br />
An azure-border'd shining ring,<br />
The gleaming dream of the approaching joy of her;&mdash;<br />
What now wilt thou do, Soul? What now,<br />
If with such things as these troubled thou wert?<br />
How wilt thou now endure, or how<br />
Not now be strangely hurt?&mdash;When<br />
utter beauty must come closer to thee<br />
Than even anger or fear could be;<br />
When thou, like metal in a kiln, must lie<br />
Seized by beauty's mightily able flame;<br />
Enjoyed by beauty as by the ruthless glee<br />
Of an unescapable power;<br />
Obeying beauty as air obeys a cry;<br />
Yea, one thing made of beauty and thee,<br />
As steel and a white heat are made the same!<br />
&mdash;Ah, but I know how this infirmity<br />
Will fail and be not, no, not memory,<br />
When I begin the marvellous hour.<br />
This only is my heart's strain'd eagerness,<br />
Long waiting for its bliss.&mdash;<br />
But from those other fears, from those<br />
That keep to Love so close,<br />
From fears that are the shadow of delight,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>Hide me, O joys; make them unknown to-night!<br />
<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
Thou bright God that in dream earnest to me last night,<br />
Thou with the flesh made of a golden light,<br />
Knew I not thee, thee and thy heart,<br />
Knew I not well, God, who thou wert?<br />
Yea, and my soul divinely understood<br />
The light that was beneath thee a ground,<br />
The golden light that cover'd thee round,<br />
Turning my sleep to a fiery morn,<br />
Was as a heavenly oath there sworn<br />
Promising me an immortal good:<br />
Well I knew thee, God of Marriages, thee and thy flame!<br />
Ah, but wherefore beside thee came<br />
That fearful sight of another mood?<br />
Why in thy light, to thy hand chained,<br />
Towards me its bondage terribly strained,<br />
Why came with thee that dreadful hound,<br />
The wild hound Fear, black, ravenous, and gaunt?<br />
Why him with thee should thy dear light surround?<br />
Why broughtest thou that beast to haunt<br />
The blissful footsteps of my golden dream?&mdash;<br />
All shadowy black the body dread,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>All frenzied fire the head,&mdash;<br />
The hunger of its mouth a hollow crimson flame,<br />
The hatred in its eyes a blaze<br />
Fierce and green, stabbing the ruddy glaze,<br />
And sharp white jetting fire the teeth snarl'd at me,<br />
And white the dribbling rage of froth,&mdash;<br />
A throat that gaped to bay and paws working violently,<br />
Yet soundless all as a winging moth;<br />
Tugging towards me, famishing for my heart;&mdash;<br />
Even while thou, O golden god, wert still<br />
Looking the beautiful kindness of thy will<br />
Into my soul, even then must I be,<br />
With thy bright promise looking at me,<br />
Then bitterly of that hound afraid?&mdash;<br />
Darkness, I know, attendeth bright,<br />
And light comes not but shadow comes:<br />
And heart must know, if it know thy light,<br />
Thy wild hound Fear, the shadow of love's delight.<br />
Yea, is it thus? Are we so made<br />
Of death and darkness, that even thou,<br />
O golden God of the joys of love,<br />
Thy mind to us canst only prove,<br />
The glorious devices of thy mind,<br />
By so revealing how thy journeying here<br />
Through this mortality, doth closely bind<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>Thy brightness to the shadow of dreadful Fear?&mdash;<br />
Ah no, it shall not be! Thy joyous light<br />
Shall hide me from the hunger of fear to-night.<br />
<br />
<br />
IV<br />
<br />
For wonderfully to live I now begin.<br />
So that the darkness which accompanies<br />
Our being here, is fasten'd up within<br />
The power of light that holdeth me;<br />
And from these shining chains, to see<br />
My joy with bold misliking eyes,<br />
The shrouded figure will not dare arise.<br />
For henceforth, from to-night,<br />
I am wholly gone into the bright<br />
Safety of the beauty of love:<br />
Not only all my waking vigours plied<br />
Under the searching glory of love,<br />
But knowing myself with love all satisfied<br />
Even when my life is hidden in sleep;<br />
As high clouds, to themselves that keep<br />
The moon's white company, are all possest<br />
Silverly with the presence of their guest;<br />
Or as a darken'd room<br />
That hath within it roses, whence the air<br />
And quietness are taken everywhere<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>Deliciously by sweet perfume.<br />
<br />
<br />
EPILOGUE<br />
<br />
What shall we do for Love these days?<br />
How shall we make an altar-blaze<br />
To smite the horny eyes of men<br />
With the renown of our Heaven,<br />
And to the unbelievers prove<br />
Our service to our dear god, Love?<br />
What torches shall we lift above<br />
The crowd that pushes through the mire,<br />
To amaze the dark heads with strange fire?<br />
I should think I were much to blame,<br />
If never I held some fragrant flame<br />
Above the noises of the world,<br />
And openly 'mid men's hurrying stares,<br />
Worshipt before the sacred fears<br />
That are like flashing curtains furl'd<br />
Across the presence of our lord Love.<br />
Nay, would that I could fill the gaze<br />
Of the whole earth with some great praise<br />
Made in a marvel for men's eyes,<br />
Some tower of glittering masonries,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Therein such a spirit flourishing<br />
Men should see what my heart can sing:<br />
All that Love hath done to me<br />
Built into stone, a visible glee;<br />
Marble carried to gleaming height<br />
As moved aloft by inward delight;<br />
Not as with toil of chisels hewn,<br />
But seeming poised in a mighty tune.<br />
For of all those who have been known<br />
To lodge with our kind host, the sun,<br />
I envy one for just one thing:<br />
In Cordova of the Moors<br />
There dwelt a passion-minded King,<br />
Who set great bands of marble-hewers<br />
To fashion his heart's thanksgiving<br />
In a tall palace, shapen so<br />
All the wondering world might know<br />
The joy he had of his Moorish lass.<br />
His love, that brighter and larger was<br />
Than the starry places, into firm stone<br />
He sent, as if the stone were glass<br />
Fired and into beauty blown.<br />
<br />
Solemn and invented gravely<br />
In its bulk the fabric stood,<br />
Even as Love, that trusteth bravely<br />
In its own exceeding good<br />
To be better than the waste<br />
Of time's devices; grandly spaced,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Seriously the fabric stood.<br />
But over it all a pleasure went<br />
Of carven delicate ornament,<br />
Wreathing up like ravishment,<br />
Mentioning in sculptures twined<br />
The blitheness Love hath in his mind;<br />
And like delighted senses were<br />
The windows, and the columns there<br />
Made the following sight to ache<br />
As the heart that did them make.<br />
Well I can see that shining song<br />
Flowering there, the upward throng<br />
Of porches, pillars and windowed walls,<br />
Spires like piercing panpipe calls,<br />
Up to the roof's snow-cloud flight;<br />
All glancing in the Spanish light<br />
White as water of arctic tides,<br />
Save an amber dazzle on sunny sides.<br />
You had said, the radiant sheen<br />
Of that palace might have been<br />
A young god's fantasy, ere he came<br />
His serious worlds and suns to frame;<br />
Such an immortal passion<br />
Quiver'd among the slim hewn stone.<br />
And in the nights it seemed a jar<br />
Cut in the substance of a star,<br />
Wherein a wine, that will be poured<br />
Some time for feasting Heaven, was stored.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>But within this fretted shell,<br />
The wonder of Love made visible,<br />
The King a private gentle mood<br />
There placed, of pleasant quietude.<br />
For right amidst there was a court,<br />
Where always musked silences<br />
Listened to water and to trees;<br />
And herbage of all fragrant sort,&mdash;Lavender,<br />
lad's-love, rosemary,<br />
Basil, tansy, centaury,&mdash;<br />
Was the grass of that orchard, hid<br />
Love's amazements all amid.<br />
Jarring the air with rumour cool,<br />
Small fountains played into a pool<br />
With sound as soft as the barley's hiss<br />
When its beard just sprouting is;<br />
Whence a young stream, that trod on moss,<br />
Prettily rimpled the court across.<br />
And in the pool's clear idleness,<br />
Moving like dreams through happiness,<br />
Shoals of small bright fishes were;<br />
In and out weed-thickets bent<br />
Perch and carp, and sauntering went<br />
With mounching jaws and eyes a-stare;<br />
Or on a lotus leaf would crawl,<br />
A brinded loach to bask and sprawl,<br />
Tasting the warm sun ere it dipt<br />
Into the water; but quick as fear<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Back his shining brown head slipt<br />
To crouch on the gravel of his lair,<br />
Where the cooled sunbeams broke in wrack,<br />
Spilt shatter'd gold about his back.<br />
<br />
So within that green-veiled air,<br />
Within that white-walled quiet, where<br />
Innocent water thought aloud,&mdash;<br />
Childish prattle that must make<br />
The wise sunlight with laughter shake<br />
On the leafage overbowed,&mdash;<br />
Often the King and his love-lass<br />
Let the delicious hours pass.<br />
All the outer world could see<br />
Graved and sawn amazingly<br />
Their love's delighted riotise,<br />
Fixt in marble for all men's eyes;<br />
But only these twain could abide<br />
In the cool peace that withinside<br />
Thrilling desire and passion dwelt;<br />
They only knew the still meaning spelt<br />
By Love's flaming script, which is<br />
God's word written in ecstasies.<br />
<br />
And where is now that palace gone,<br />
All the magical skill'd stone,<br />
All the dreaming towers wrought<br />
By Love as if no more than thought<br />
The unresisting marble was?<br />
How could such a wonder pass?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>Ah, it was but built in vain<br />
Against the stupid horns of Rome,<br />
That pusht down into the common loam<br />
The loveliness that shone in Spain.<br />
But we have raised it up again!<br />
A loftier palace, fairer far,<br />
Is ours, and one that fears no war.<br />
Safe in marvellous walls we are;<br />
Wondering sense like builded fires,<br />
High amazement of desires,<br />
Delight and certainty of love,<br />
Closing around, roofing above<br />
Our unapproacht and perfect hour<br />

THE BUZZARDS<br />
<br />
<br />
When evening came and the warm glow grew deeper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every tree that bordered the green meadows</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the yellow cornfields every reaper</span><br />
And every corn-shock stood above their shadows<br />
Flung eastward from their feet in longer measure,<br />
Serenely far there swam in the sunny height<br />
A buzzard and his mate who took their pleasure<br />
Swirling and poising idly in golden light.<br />
<br />
On great pied motionless moth-wings borne along,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So effortless and so strong,</span><br />
Cutting each other's paths together they glided,<br />
Then wheeled asunder till they soared divided<br />
Two valleys' width (as though it were delight<br />
To part like this, being sure they could unite<br />
So swiftly in their empty, free dominion),<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Curved headlong downward, towered up the sunny steep,<br />
Then, with a sudden lift of the one great pinion,<br />
Swung proudly to a curve, and from its height<br />
Took half a mile of sunlight in one long sweep.<br />
<br />
And we, so small on the swift immense hillside,<br />
Stood tranced, until our souls arose uplifted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On those far-sweeping, wide,</span><br />
Strong curves of flight&mdash;swayed up and hugely drifted,<br />
Were washed, made strong and beautiful in the tide<br />
Of sun-bathed air. But far beneath, beholden<br />
Through shining deeps of air, the fields were golden<br />
And rosy burned the heather where cornfields ended.<br />
<br />
And still those buzzards whirled, while light withdrew<br />
Out of the vales and to surging slopes ascended,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Till the loftiest flaming summit died to blue.<br />

<i>To</i> J. C. S.<br />
<br />
<br />
The snows have fled, the hail, the lashing rain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Before the Spring.</span><br />
The grass is starred with buttercups again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The blackbirds sing.</span><br />
<br />
Now spreads the month that feast of lovely things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">We loved of old.</span><br />
Once more the swallow glides with darkling wings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Against the gold.</span><br />
<br />
Now the brown bees about the peach trees boom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Upon the walls;</span><br />
And far away beyond the orchard's bloom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The cuckoo calls.</span><br />
<br />
The season holds a festival of light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For you, for me;</span><br />
But shadows are abroad, there falls a blight<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">On each green tree.</span><br />
<br />
And every leaf unfolding, every flower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Brings bitter meed;</span><br />
Beauty of the morning and the evening hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Quickens our need.</span><br />
<br />
All is reborn, but never any Spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Can bring back this;</span><br />
Nor any fullness of midsummer bring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The voice we miss.</span><br />
<br />
The smiling eyes shall smile on us no more;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The laughter clear,</span><br />
Too far away on the forbidden shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">We shall not hear.</span><br />
<br />
Bereft of these until the day we die,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">We both must dwell;</span><br />
Alone, alone, and haunted by the cry:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Hail and farewell!</span><br />
<br />
Yet when the scythe of Death shall near us hiss,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Through the cold air,</span><br />
Then on the shuddering marge of the abyss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">They will be there.</span><br />
<br />
They will be there to lift us from sheer space<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And empty night;</span><br />
And we shall turn and see them face to face<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">In the new light.</span><br />
<br />
So shall we pay the unabated price<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Of their release,</span><br />
And found on our consenting sacrifice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Their lasting peace.</span><br />
<br />
The hopes that fall like leaves before the wind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The baffling waste,</span><br />
And every earthly joy that leaves behind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A mortal taste.</span><br />
<br />
The uncompleted end of all things dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The clanging door</span><br />
Of Death, forever loud with the last fear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Haunt them no more.</span><br />
<br />
Without them the awakening world is dark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With dust and mire;</span><br />
Yet as they went they flung to us a spark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A thread of fire.</span><br />
<br />
To guide us while beneath the sombre skies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Faltering we tread,</span><br />
Until for us like morning stars shall rise<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">The deathless dead.</span><br />

Because of you we will be glad and gay,<br />
Remembering you, we will be brave and strong;<br />
And hail the advent of each dangerous day,<br />
And meet the last adventure with a song.<br />
And, as you proudly gave your jewelled gift,<br />
We'll give our lesser offering with a smile,<br />
Nor falter on that path where, all too swift,<br />
You led the way and leapt the golden stile.<br />
<br />
Whether new paths, new heights to climb you find,<br />
Or gallop through the unfooted asphodel,<br />
We know you know we shall not lag behind,<br />
Nor halt to waste a moment on a fear;<br />
And you will speed us onward with a cheer,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>And wave beyond the stars that all is well.<br />

PIERRE<br />
<br />
<br />
I saw you starting for another war,<br />
The emblem of adventure and of youth,<br />
So that men trembled, saying: He forsooth<br />
Has gone, has gone, and shall return no more.<br />
And then out there, they told me you were dead<br />
Taken and killed; how was it that I knew,<br />
Whatever else was true, that was not true?<br />
And then I saw you pale upon your bed,<br />
<br />
Scarcely a year ago, when you were sent<br />
Back from the margin of the dim abyss;<br />
For Death had sealed you with a warning kiss,<br />
And let you go to meet a nobler fate:<br />
To serve in fellowship, O fortunate:<br />
<br />To die in battle with your regiment.<br />

THE SOUTH COUNTRY<br />
<br />
<br />
When I am living in the Midlands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That are sodden and unkind,</span><br />
I light my lamp in the evening:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My work is left behind;</span><br />
And the great hills of the South Country<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come back into my mind.</span><br />
<br />
The great hills of the South Country<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They stand along the sea;</span><br />
And it's there walking in the high woods<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I could wish to be,</span><br />
And the men that were boys when I was a boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walking along with me.</span><br />
<br />
The men that live in North England<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw them for a day;</span><br />
Their hearts are set upon the waste fells,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their skies are fast and grey;</span><br />
From their castle-walls a man may see<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mountains far away.</span><br />
<br />
The men that live in West England<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They see the Severn strong,</span><br />
A-rolling on rough water brown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Light aspen leaves along.</span><br />
They have the secret of the Rocks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the oldest kind of song.</span><br />
<br />
But the men that live in the South Country<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are the kindest and most wise,</span><br />
They get their laughter from the loud surf,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the faith in their happy eyes</span><br />
Comes surely from our Sister the Spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When over the sea she flies;</span><br />
The violets suddenly bloom at her feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She blesses us with surprise.</span><br />
<br />
I never get between the pines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I smell the Sussex air;</span><br />
Nor I never come on a belt of sand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But my home is there.</span><br />
And along the sky the line of the Downs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So noble and so bare.</span><br />
<br />
A lost thing could I never find,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor a broken thing mend:</span><br />
And I fear I shall be all alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I get towards the end.</span><br />
Who will there be to comfort me<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or who will be my friend?</span><br />
<br />
I will gather and carefully make my friends<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the men of the Sussex Weald,</span><br />
They watch the stars from silent folds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They stiffly plough the field,</span><br />
By them and the God of the South Country<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My poor soul shall be healed.</span><br />
<br />
If I ever become a rich man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of if ever I grow to be old,</span><br />
I will build a house with deep thatch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To shelter me from the cold,</span><br />
And there shall the Sussex songs be sung<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the story of Sussex told.</span><br />
<br />
I will hold my house in the high wood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within a walk of the sea,</span><br />
And the men that were boys when I was a boy<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall sit and drink with me.</span><br />

THE NIGHT<br />
<br />
<br />
Most holy Night, that still dost keep<br />
The keys of all the doors of sleep,<br />
To me when my tired eyelids close<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Give thou repose.</span><br />
<br />
And let the far lament of them<br />
That chant the dead day's requiem<br />
Make in my ears, who wakeful lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Soft lullaby.</span><br />
<br />
Let them that knaw the horned moth<br />
By my bedside their memories clothe.<br />
So shall I have new dreams and blest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In my brief rest.</span><br />
<br />
Fold your great wings about my face,<br />
Hide dawning from my resting-place,<br />
And cheat me with your false delight,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Most Holy Night.</span><br />

ALMSWOMEN<br />
<br />
<br />
At Quincey's moat the squandering village ends,<br />
And there in the almshouse dwell the dearest friends<br />
Of all the village, two old dames that cling<br />
As close as any trueloves in the spring.<br />
Long, long ago they passed three-score-and-ten,<br />
And in this doll's house lived together then;<br />
All things they have in common being so poor,<br />
And their one fear, Death's shadow at the door.<br />
Each sundown makes them mournful, each sunrise<br />
Brings back the brightness in their failing eyes.<br />
<br />
How happy go the rich fair-weather days<br />
When on the roadside folk stare in amaze<br />
At such a honeycomb of fruit and flowers<br />
As mellows round their threshold; what long hours<br />
They gloat upon their steepling hollyhocks,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Bee's balsams, feathery southernwood and stocks,<br />
Fiery dragons'-mouths, great mallow leaves<br />
For salves, and lemon plants in bushy sheaves,<br />
Shagged Esau's Hands with five green finger-tips!<br />
Such old sweet names are ever on their lips.<br />
As pleased as little children where these grow<br />
In cobbled pattens and worn gowns they go,<br />
Proud of their wisdom when on gooseberry shoots<br />
They stuck egg-shells to fright from coming fruits<br />
The brisk-billed rascals; waiting still to see<br />
Their neighbour owls saunter from tree to tree<br />
Or in the hushing half-light mouse the lane<br />
Long-winged and lordly.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">But when those hours wane</span><br />
Indoors they ponder, scared by the harsh storm<br />
Whose pelting saracens on the window swarm,<br />
And listen for the mail to clatter past<br />
And church clock's deep bay withering on the blast;<br />
They feed the fire that flings a freakish light<br />
On pictured kings and queens grotesquely bright,<br />
Platters and pitchers, faded calendars,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
And graceful hour-glass trim with lavenders.<br />
Many a time they kiss and cry, and pray<br />
Both may be summoned in the self-same day,<br />
And wiseman linnet tinkling in his cage<br />
End too with them the friendship of old age,<br />
And all together leave their treasured room<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Some bell-like evening when the May's in bloom.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GLEANING<br />
<br />
<br />
Along the baulk the grasses drenched in dews<br />
Soak through the morning gleaners' clumsy shoes,<br />
And cloying cobwebs trammel their brown cheeks<br />
While from the shouldering sun the dewfog reeks.<br />
Then soon begun, on ground where yesterday<br />
The rakers' warning-sheaf forbade their way,<br />
Hard clucking dames in great white hoods make haste<br />
To cram their lap-bags with the barley waste,<br />
Scrambling as if a thousand were but one,<br />
Careless of stabbing thistles. Now the sun<br />
Gulps up the dew and dries the stubs, and scores<br />
Of tiny people trundle out of doors<br />
Among the stiff stalks, where the scratched hands<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Red ants and blackamoors and such as fly;<br />
Tunbellied, too, with legs a finger long,<br />
The spider harvestman; the churlish, strong<br />
Black scorpion, prickled earwig, and that mite<br />
Who shuts up like a leaden shot in fright<br />
And lies for dead. And still before the rout<br />
The young rats and the field mice whisk about<br />
And from the trod whisp out the leveret darts<br />
Bawled at by boys that pass with blundering carts<br />
Top-heavy to the red-tiled barns. And still<br />
The children feed their cornsacks with goodwill,<br />
And farm wives ever faster stoop and flounce.<br />
The hawk drops down a plummet's speed to pounce<br />
The nibbling mouse or resting lark away,<br />
The lost mole tries to pierce the mattocked clay<br />
In agony and terror of the sun.<br />
<br />
The dinner hour and its grudged leisure won,<br />
All sit below the pollards on the dykes,<br />
Rasped with the twinge of creeping barley spikes:<br />
Sweet beyond telling now the small beer goes<br />
From the hooped hardwood bottles, the wasp knows,<br />
And even hornets whizz from the eaten ash&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Then crusts are dropt and switches snatched to slash,<br />
While, safe in shadow of the apron thrown<br />
Aside the bush which years before was grown<br />
To snap the poacher's nets, the baby sleeps.<br />
Now toil returns, in red-hot fluttering light,<br />
And far afield the weary rabble creeps,<br />
Oft clutching blind wheat black among the white,<br />
That smutches where it touches quick as soot&mdash;Oft<br />
gaping where the landrail seems afoot,<br />
Who with such magic throws his baffling speech,<br />
Far off he sounds when scarce beyond arm's reach.<br />
Mongrels are left to mind the morning's gain,<br />
But squinting knaves can slouch to steal the grain;<br />
Now close the farm the fields are gleaned agen,<br />
Where the boy droves the turkey and white hen<br />
To pick the shelled sweet corn; their hue and cry<br />
Answers the gleaners' gabble, and sows trudge<br />
With little pigs to play and rootle there<br />
And all the fields are full of din and blare.<br />
<br />
So steals the time past, so they glean and gloat;<br />
The hobby-horses whir, the moth's dust coat<br />
Blends with the stubble, scarlet soldiers fly<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>In airy pleasure; but the gleaners' eye<br />
Sees little but their spoil, or robin flower<br />
Ever on tenterhooks to shun the shower,<br />
Their weather-prophet never known astray;<br />
When he folds up, then toward the hedge glean they.<br />
But now the dragon of the sky droops, pales,<br />
And wandering in the wet grey western vales,<br />
Stumbles, and passes, and the gleaning's done.<br />
The farmer, with fat hares slung on his gun,<br />
Gives folk goodnight as down the ruts they pull<br />
The creaking two-wheeled hand carts bursting full,<br />
And whimpering children cease their teasing squalls,<br />
While left alone the supping partridge calls&mdash;<br />
Till all at home is stacked from mischief's way<br />
To thrash and dress the first wild, windy day,<br />
And each good wife crowns weariness with pride,<br />
<span class="pagenum"></span>With such small riches more than satisfied.<br />

THE PLOUGHMAN<br />
<br />
<br />
Under the long fell's stony eaves<br />
The ploughman, going up and down,<br />
Ridge after ridge man's tide-mark leaves,<br />
And turns the hard grey soil to brown.<br />
<br />
Striding, he measures out the earth<br />
In lines of life, to rain and sun;<br />
And every year that comes to birth<br />
Sees him still striding on and on.<br />
<br />
The seasons change, and then return;<br />
Yet still, in blind, unsparing ways,<br />
However I may shrink or yearn,<br />
The ploughman measures out my days.<br />
<br />
His acre brought forth roots last year;<br />
This year it bears the gloomy grain;<br />
Next Spring shall seedling grass appear;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>Then roots and corn and grass again.<br />
<br />
Five times the young corn's pallid green<br />
I have seen spread and change and thrill;<br />
Five times the reapers I have seen<br />
Go creeping up the far-off hill:<br />
<br />
And, as the unknowing ploughman climbs<br />
Slowly and inveterately,<br />
I wonder long how many times<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>The corn will spring again for me.<br />

BABEL: THE GATE OF THE GOD<br />
<br />
<br />
Lost towers impend, copeless primeval props<br />
Of the new threatening sky, and first rude digits<br />
Of awe remonstrance and uneasy power<br />
Thrust out by man when speech sank back in his throat:<br />
Then had the last rocks ended bubbling up<br />
And rhythms of change within the heart begun<br />
By a blind need that would make Springs and Winters;<br />
Pylons and monoliths went on by ages,<br />
Mycenae and Great Zimbabwe came about;<br />
Cowed hearts in This conceived a pyramid<br />
That leaned to hold itself upright, a thing<br />
Foredoomed to limits, death and an easy apex;<br />
Then postulants for the stars' previous wisdom<br />
Standing on Carthage must get nearer still;<br />
While in Chaldea an altitude of God<br />
Being mooted, and a Saurian unearthed<br />
Upon a mountain stirring a surmise<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Of floods and alterations of the sea,<br />
A round-walled tower must rise upon Senaai<br />
Temple and escape to God the ascertained.<br />
These are decayed like Time's teeth in his mouth,<br />
Black cavities and gaps, yet earth is darkened<br />
By their deep-sunken and unfounded shadows<br />
And memories of man's earliest theme of towers.<br />
<br />
Space&mdash;the old source of time&mdash;should be undone,<br />
Eternity defined, by men who trusted<br />
Another tier would equal them with God.<br />
A city of grimed brick-kilns, squat truncations,<br />
Hunched like spread toads yet high beneath their circles<br />
Of low packed smoke, assemblages of thunder<br />
That glowed upon their under sides by night<br />
And lit like storm small shadowless workmen's toil.<br />
Meaningless stumps, unturned bare roots, remained<br />
In fields of mashy mud and trampled leaves,<br />
While, if a horse died hauling, plasterers<br />
Knelt on a plank to clip its sweaty coat.<br />
A builder leans across the last wide courses;<br />
His unadjustable unreaching eyes<br />
Fail under him before his glances sink<br />
On the clouds' upper layers of sooty curls<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Where some long lightening goes like swallow downward,<br />
But at the wider gallery next below<br />
Recognize master masons with pricked parchments:<br />
That builder then, as one who condescends<br />
Unto the sea and all that is beneath him,<br />
His hairy breast on the wet mortar calls<br />
"How many fathoms is it yet to heaven!"<br />
On the next eminence the orgulous King<br />
Nimrond stands up conceiving he shall live<br />
To conquer God, now that he knows where God is:<br />
His eager hands push up the tower in thought...<br />
Again, his shaggy inhuman height strides down<br />
Among the carpenters because he has seen<br />
One shape an eagle-woman on a door-post:<br />
He drives his spear-beam through him for wasted<br />
day.<br />
<br />
Little men hurrying, running here and there,<br />
Within the dark and stifling walls, dissent<br />
From every sound, and shoulder empty hods:<br />
"The God's great altar should stand in the crypt<br />
Among our earth's foundations "&mdash;"The God's great altar<br />
Must be the last far coping of our work"&mdash;<br />
"It should inaugurate the broad main stair"&mdash;<br />
"Or end it"&mdash;"It must stand toward the East!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>But here a grave contemptuous youth cries out<br />
"Womanish babblers, how can we build God's altar<br />
Ere we divine its foreordained true shape?"<br />
Then one "It is a pedestal for deeds"&mdash;<br />
"'Tis more and should be hewn like the King's brow"&mdash;<br />
"It has the nature of a woman's bosom"&mdash;<br />
"The tortoise, first created, signifies it"&mdash;<br />
"A blind and rudimentary navel shows<br />
The source of worship better than horned moons."<br />
Then a lean giant "Is not a calyx needful?"&mdash;<br />
"Because round grapes on statues well expressed<br />
Become the nadir of incense, nodal lamps,<br />
Yet apes have hands that but and carved red crystals&mdash;"<br />
"Birds molten, touchly tale veins bronze buds crumble<br />
Ablid ublai ghan isz rad eighar ghaurl ..."<br />
Words said too often seemed such ancient sounds<br />
That men forget them or were lost in them;<br />
The guttural glottis-chasms of language reached<br />
A rhythm, a gasp, were curves of immortal thought.<br />
<br />
Man with his bricks was building, building yet,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>Where dawn and midnight mingled and woke no birds,<br />
In the last courses, building past his knowledge<br />
A wall that swung&mdash;for towers can have no tops,<br />
No chord can mete the universal segment,<br />
Earth has no basis. Yet the yielding sky,<br />
Invincible vacancy, was there discovered&mdash;<br />
Though piled-up bricks should pulp the sappy balks,<br />
Weight generate a secrecy of heat,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Cankerous charring, crevices' fronds of flame.<br />

THE END OF THE WORLD<br />
<br />
<br />
The snow had fallen many nights and days;<br />
The sky was come upon the earth at last,<br />
Sifting thinly down as endlessly<br />
As though within the system of blind planets<br />
Something had been forgot or overdriven.<br />
The dawn now seemed neglected in the grey<br />
Where mountains were unbuilt and shadowless trees<br />
Rootlessly paused or hung upon the air.<br />
There was no wind, but now and then a sigh<br />
Crossed that dry falling dust and rifted it<br />
Through crevices of slate and door and casement.<br />
Perhaps the new moon's time was even past.<br />
Outside, the first white twilights were too void<br />
Until a sheep called once, as to a lamb,<br />
And tenderness crept everywhere from it;<br />
But now the flock must have strayed far away.<br />
The lights across the valley must be veiled,<br />
The smoke lost in the greyness or the dusk.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>For more than three days now the snow had thatched<br />
That cow-house roof where it had ever melted<br />
With yellow stains from the beasts' breath inside;<br />
But yet a dog howled there, though not quite lately.<br />
Someone passed down the valley swift and singing,<br />
Yes, with locks spreaded like a son of morning;<br />
But if he seemed too tall to be a man<br />
It was that men had been so long unseen,<br />
Or shapes loom larger through a moving snow.<br />
And he was gone and food had not been given him.<br />
When snow slid from an overweighted leaf<br />
Shaking the tree, it might have been a bird<br />
Slipping in sleep or shelter, whirring wings;<br />
Yet never bird fell out, save once a dead one&mdash;<br />
And in two days the snow had covered it.<br />
The dog had howled again&mdash;or thus it seemed<br />
Until a lean fox passed and cried no more.<br />
All was so safe indoors where life went on<br />
Glad of the close enfolding snow&mdash;O glad<br />
To be so safe and secret at its heart,<br />
Watching the strangeness of familiar things.<br />
They knew not what dim hours went on, went<br />
For while they slept the clock stopt newly wound<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>As the cold hardened. Once they watched the road,<br />
Thinking to be remembered. Once they doubted<br />
If they had kept the sequence of the days,<br />
Because they heard not any sound of bells.<br />
A butterfly, that hid until the Spring<br />
Under a ceiling's shadow, dropt, was dead.<br />
The coldness seemed more nigh, the coldness deepened<br />
As a sound deepens into silences;<br />
It was of earth and came not by the air;<br />
The earth was cooling and drew down the sky.<br />
The air was crumbling. There was no more sky.<br />
Rails of a broken bed charred in the grate,<br />
And when he touched the bars he thought the sting<br />
Came from their heat&mdash;he could not feel such cold ...<br />
She said "O do not sleep,<br />
Heart, heart of mine, keep near me. No, no; sleep.<br />
I will not lift his fallen, quiet eyelids,<br />
Although I know he would awaken then&mdash;He<br />
closed them thus but now of his own will.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>He can stay with me while I do not lift them."<br />

ATLANTIS<br />
<br />
<br />
What poets sang in Atlantis? Who can tell<br />
The epics of Atlantis or their names?<br />
The sea hath its own murmurs, and sounds not<br />
The secrets of its silences beneath,<br />
And knows not any cadences enfolded<br />
When the last bubbles of Atlantis broke<br />
Among the quieting of its heaving floor.<br />
<br />
O, years and tides and leagues and all their billows<br />
Can alter not man's knowledge of men's hearts&mdash;<br />
While trees and rocks and clouds include our being<br />
We know the epics of Atlantis still:<br />
A hero gave himself to lesser men,<br />
Who first misunderstood and murdered him,<br />
And then misunderstood and worshipped him;<br />
A woman was lovely and men fought for her,<br />
Towns burnt for her, and men put men in bondage,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>But she put lengthier bondage on them all;<br />
A wanderer toiled among all the isles<br />
That fleck this turning star or shifting sea,<br />
Or lonely purgatories of the mind,<br />
In longing for his home or his lost love.<br />
<br />
Poetry is founded on the hearts of men:<br />
Though in Nirvana or the Heavenly courts<br />
The principle of beauty shall persist,<br />
Its body of poetry, as the body of man,<br />
Is but a terrene form, a terrene use,<br />
That swifter being will not loiter with;<br />
And, when mankind is dead and the world cold,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Poetry's immortality will pass.<br />

NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1913<br />
<br />
<br />
O, Cartmel bells ring soft to-night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Cartmel bells ring clear</span><br />
But I lie far away to-night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Listening with my dear;</span><br />
<br />
Listening in a frosty land<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where all the bells are still</span><br />
And the small-windowed bell-towers stand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dark under heath and hill.</span><br />
<br />
I thought that, with each dying year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As long as life should last</span><br />
The bells of Cartmel I should hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ring out an aged past:</span><br />
<br />
The plunging, mingling sounds increase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Darkness's depth and height,</span><br />
The hollow valley gains more peace<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ancientness to-night:</span><br />
<br />
The loveliness, the fruitfulness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The power of life lived there</span><br />
Return, revive, more closely press<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon that midnight air.</span><br />
<br />
But many deaths have place in men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before they come to die;</span><br />
Joys must be used and spent, and then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Abandoned and passed by.</span><br />
<br />
Earth is not ours; no cherished space<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Can hold us from life's flow,</span><br />
That bears us thither and thence by ways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We knew not we should go.</span><br />
<br />
O, Cartmel bells ring loud, ring clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through midnight deep and hoar,</span><br />
A year new-born, and I shall hear<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Cartmel bells no more.</span><br />

TO IRON-FOUNDERS AND OTHERS<br />
<br />
<br />
When you destroy a blade of grass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You poison England at her roots:</span><br />
Remember no man's foot can pass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where evermore no green life shoots.</span><br />
<br />
You force the birds to wing too high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where your unnatural vapours creep:</span><br />
Surely the living rocks shall die<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When birds no rightful distance keep.</span><br />
<br />
You have brought down the firmament<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet no heaven is more near;</span><br />
You shape huge deeds without event,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And half made men believe and fear.</span><br />
<br />
Your worship is your furnaces,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which, like old idols, lost obscenes,</span><br />
Have molten bowels; your vision is<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Machines for making more machines.</span><br />
<br />
O, you are buried in the night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Preparing destinies of rust;</span><br />
Iron misused must turn to blight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dwindle to a tettered crust.</span><br />
<br />
The grass, forerunner of life, has gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But plants that spring in ruins and shards</span><br />
Attend until your dream is done:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have seen hemlock in your yards.</span><br />
<br />
The generations of the worm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Know not your loads piled on their soil;</span><br />
Their knotted ganglions shall wax firm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till your strong flagstones heave and toil.</span><br />
<br />
When the old hollowed earth is cracked,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when, to grasp more power and feasts,</span><br />
Its ores are emptied, wasted, lacked,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The middens of your burning beasts</span><br />
<br />
Shall be raked over till they yield<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Last priceless slags for fashionings high,</span><br />
Ploughs to make grass in every field,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chisels men's hands to magnify.</span><br />

SONNET<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh! Death will find me, long before I tire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of watching you; and swing me suddenly</span><br />
Into the shade and loneliness and mire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the last land! There, waiting patiently,</span><br />
<br />
One day, I think, I'll feel a cool wind blowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">See a slow light across the Stygian tide,</span><br />
And hear the Dead about me stir, unknowing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tremble. And <i>I</i> shall know that you have died.</span><br />
<br />
And watch you, a broad-browed and smiling dream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pass, light as ever, through the lightless host,</span><br />
Quietly ponder, start, and sway, and gleam&mdash;<br />

If I should die, trunk only this of me:<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;</span><br />
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,<br />

A body of England's, breathing English air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.</span><br />
<br />
And think, this heart, all evil shed away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pulse in the eternal mind, no less</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;</span><br />

<br />
THE GREAT LOVER<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been so great a lover I filled my days<br />
So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,<br />
The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,<br />
Desire illimitable, and still content,<br />
And all dear names men use, to cheat despair<br />
For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear<br />
Our hearts at random down the dark of life.<br />
Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife<br />
Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,<br />
My night shall be remembered for a star<br />
That outshone all the suns of all men's days.<br />
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise<br />
Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me<br />
High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see<br />
The inenarrable godhead of delight?<br />
Love is a flame:&mdash;we have beaconed the world's night.<br />
A city:&mdash;and we have built it, these and I.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
An emperor:&mdash;we have taught the world to die.<br />
So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,<br />
And the high cause of Love's magnificence,<br />
And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names<br />
Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,<br />
And set them as a banner, that men may know,<br />
To dare the generations, burn, and blow<br />
Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming......<br />
<br />
These I have loved:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,</span><br />
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;<br />
Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong<br />
Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;<br />
Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;<br />
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;<br />
And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,<br />
Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;<br />
Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon<br />
Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss<br />
Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is<br />
Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Impassioned beauty of a great machine;<br />
The benison of hot water; furs to touch;<br />
The good smell of old clothes; and other such&mdash;<br />
The comfortable smell of friendly ringers,<br />
Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers<br />
About dead leaves and last year's ferns ...<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Dear names,</span><br />
And thousand other throng to me! Royal flames;<br />
Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;<br />
Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;<br />
Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,<br />
Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;<br />
Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam<br />
That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;<br />
And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold<br />
Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;<br />
Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;<br />
And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;<br />
And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass;&mdash;<br />
All these have been my loves. And these shall pass,<br />
Whatever passes not, in the great hour,<br />
Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power<br />
To hold them with me through the gate of Death.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,<br />
Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust<br />
And sacramented covenant to the dust.<br />
&mdash;Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,<br />
And give what's left of love again; and make<br />
New friends, now strangers....<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">But the best I've known,</span><br />
Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown<br />
About the winds of the world, and fades from<br />
brains Of living men, and dies.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Nothing remains.</span><br />
<br />
O dear my loves, O faithless, once again<br />
This one last gift I give: that after men<br />
Shall know, and later lovers, far removed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>Praise you, 'All these were lovely'; say, 'He loved.'<br />

Down the blue night the unending columns press<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In noiseless tumult, break and wave and flow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now tread the far South, or lift rounds of snow</span><br />
Up to the white moon's hidden loveliness.<br />
Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And turn with profound gesture vague and slow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As who would pray good for the world, but know</span><br />
Their benediction empty as they bless.<br />
<br />
They say that the Dead die not, but remain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Near to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I think they ride the calm mid-heaven, as these,</span><br />
In wise majestic melancholy train,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And watch the moon, and the still-raging seas,</span><br />
And men, coming and going on the earth.<br />

Just now the lilac is in bloom,<br />
All before my little room;<br />
And in my flower-beds, I think,<br />
Smile the carnation and the pink;<br />
And down the borders, well I know,<br />
The poppy and the pansy blow ...<br />
Oh! there the chestnuts, summer through,<br />
Beside the river make for you<br />
A tunnel of green gloom, and sleep<br />
Deeply above; and green and deep<br />
The stream mysterious glides beneath,<br />
Green as a dream and deep as death.&mdash;<br />
Oh, damn! I know it I and I know<br />
How the May fields all golden show,<br />
And when the day is young and sweet,<br />
Gild gloriously the bare feet<br />
That run to bathe ...<br />

Day long and watch the Cambridge sky,<br />
And, flower-lulled in sleepy grass,<br />
Hear the cool lapse of hours pass,<br />
Until the centuries blend and blur<br />
In Grantchester, in Grantchester ...<br />
Still in the dawnlit waters cool<br />
His ghostly Lordship swims his pool,<br />
And tries the strokes, essays the tricks,<br />
Long learnt on Hellespont, or Styx;<br />
Dan Chaucer hears his river still<br />
Chatter beneath a phantom mill;<br />
Tennyson notes, with studious eye,<br />
How Cambridge waters hurry by ...<br />
And in that garden, black and white<br />
Creep whispers through the grass all night;<br />
And spectral dance, before the dawn,<br />
A hundred Vicars down the lawn;<br />
Curates, long dust, will come and go<br />
On lissom, clerical, printless toe;<br />
And oft between the boughs is seen<br />
The sly shade of a Rural Dean ...<br />
Till, at a shiver in the skies,<br />
Vanishing with Satanic cries,<br />
The prim ecclesiastic rout<br />
Leaves but a startled sleeper-out,<br />
Grey heavens, the first bird's drowsy calls,<br />
The falling house that never falls.<br />

God! I will pack, and take a train,<br />
And get me to England once again!<br />
For England's the one land, I know,<br />
Where men with Splendid Hearts may go;<br />
And Cambridgeshire, of all England,<br />
The shire for Men who Understand;<br />
And of <i>that</i> district I prefer<br />
The lovely hamlet Grantchester.<br />
For Cambridge people rarely smile,<br />
Being urban, squat, and packed with guile;<br />
And Royston men in the far South<br />
Are black and fierce and strange of mouth;<br />
At Over they fling oaths at one,<br />
And worse than oaths at Trumpington,<br />
And Ditton girls are mean and dirty,<br />
And there's none in Harston under thirty,<br />
And folks in Shelford and those parts<br />
Have twisted lips and twisted hearts,<br />
And Barton men make cockney rhymes,<br />
And Co ton's full of nameless crimes,<br />
And things are done you'd not believe<br />

Strong men have run for miles and miles<br />
When one from Cherry Hinton smiles;<br />
Strong men have blanched and shot their wives<br />
Rather than send them to St. Ives;<br />
Strong men have cried like babes, bydam,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>To hear what happened at Babraham.<br />
But Grantchester, ah, Grantchester!<br />
There's peace and holy quiet there,<br />
Great clouds along pacific skies,<br />
And men and women with straight eyes,<br />
Lithe children lovelier than a dream,<br />
A bosky wood, a slumbrous stream,<br />
And little kindly winds that creep<br />
Round twilight corners, half asleep.<br />
In Grantchester their skins are white,<br />
In Grantchester their skins are white,<br />
They bathe by day, they bathe by night;<br />

<br />
Ah God! to see the branches stir<br />
Across the moon at Grantchester!<br />
To smell the thrilling-sweet and rotten<br />
Unforgettable, unforgotten<br />
River smell, and hear the breeze<br />
Sobbing in the little trees.<br />
Say, do the elm-clumps greatly stand,<br />
Still guardians of that holy land?<br />
The chestnuts shade, in reverend dream,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>The yet unacademic stream?<br />
Is dawn a secret shy and cold<br />
Anadyomene, silver-gold?<br />

Do hares come out about the corn?<br />
Oh, is the water sweet and cool<br />
Gentle and brown, above the pool?<br />
And laughs the immortal river still&mdash;<br />
Under the mill, under the mill?<br />
Say, is there Beauty yet to find?<br />

THE BUSY HEART<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that we've clone our best and worst, and parted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend.</span><br />
(O heart, I do not dare go empty-hearted)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll think of Love in books, Love without end;</span><br />
Women with child, content; and old men sleeping;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wet strong ploughlands, scarred for certain grain;</span><br />
And babes that weep, and so forget their weeping;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the young heavens, forgetful after rain;</span><br />
And evening hush, broken by homing wings;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Song's nobility, and Wisdom holy,</span><br />
That live, we dead. I would think of a thousand things,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lovely and loveable, and taste them slowly,</span><br />
One after one, like tasting a sweet food.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>I have need to busy my heart with quietude.<br />

<br />
DINING-ROOM TEA<br />
<br />
<br />
When you were there, and you, and you,<br />
Happiness crowned the night; I too,<br />
Laughing and looking, one of all,<br />
I watched the quivering lamplight fall<br />
On plate and flowers and pouring tea<br />
And cup and cloth; and they and we<br />
Flung all the dancing moments by<br />
With jest and glitter. Lip and eye<br />
Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,<br />
Improvident, unmemoried;<br />
And fitfully and like a flame<br />
The light of laughter went and came.<br />
Proud in their careless transience moved<br />
The changing faces that I loved.<br />
<br />
Till suddenly, and otherwhence,<br />
I looked upon your innocence;<br />
For lifted clear and still and strange<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
From the dark woven flow of change<br />
Under a vast and starless sky<br />
I saw the immortal moment lie.<br />
One instant I, an instant, knew<br />
As God knows all. And it and you<br />
I, above Time, oh, blind! could see<br />
In witless immortality.<br />
I saw the marble cup; the tea,<br />
Hung on the air, an amber stream;<br />
I saw the fire's unglittering gleam,<br />
The painted flame, the frozen smoke.<br />
No more the flooding lamplight broke<br />
On flying eyes and lips and hair;<br />
But lay, but slept unbroken there,<br />
On stiller flesh, and body breathless,<br />
And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,<br />
And words on which no silence grew.<br />
Light was more alive than you.<br />
<br />
For suddenly, and otherwhence,<br />
I looked on your magnificence.<br />
I saw the stillness and the light,<br />
And you, august, immortal, white,<br />
Holy and strange; and every glint<br />
Posture and jest and thought and tint<br />
Freed from the mask of transiency,<br />
Triumphant in eternity,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Immote, immortal.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">Dazed at length</span><br />
Human eyes grew, mortal strength<br />
Wearied; and Time began to creep.<br />
Change closed about me like a sleep.<br />
Light glinted on the eyes I loved.<br />
The cup was filled. The bodies moved.<br />
The drifting petal came to ground.<br />
The laughter chimed its perfect round.<br />
The broken syllable was ended.<br />
And I, so certain and so friended,<br />
How could I cloud, or how distress<br />
The heaven of your unconsciousness?<br />
Or shake at Time's sufficient spell,<br />
Stammering of lights unutterable?<br />
The eternal holiness of you,<br />
The timeless end, you never knew,<br />
The peace that lay, the light that shone.<br />
You never knew that I had gone<br />
A million miles away, and stayed<br />
A million years. The laughter played<br />
Unbroken round me; and the jest<br />
Flashed on. And we that knew the best<br />
Down wonderful hours grew happier yet.<br />
I sang at heart, and talked, and eat,<br />
And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,<br />

<br />
Mother whose hair I grasp, whose bosom I tread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy son adopted. Thou who dost so charm me</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in thy lappels of affection warm me,</span><br />
Heap all thine other misery on my head;<br />
<br />
Madness alone of evils do I dread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against its imminent presence guard and arm me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Suffer its broad flung shadow not to harm me</span><br />
But plunge me rather with the naked dead.<br />
<br />
Yet if it must come, let it be entire;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cast then upon me unillumined night,</span><br />
One whole eclipse not knowing any fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To give it record of the former light.</span><br />
Complete destruction of the heart's desire,<br />

Remember him who battled here,<br />
What was his living character?<br />
To friends an heart for ever filled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With love and with compassion brave;</span><br />
To foes a power never stilled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In pushing vengeance to the grave;</span><br />
Where is his spirit gone now, O where?<br />
<br />
What of his ten grand paces here<br />
Whose motion was a perfect sphere?<br />
To friends a making unafraid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sure defence, a wall of glass.</span><br />
To foes a hidden trap well laid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To catch them stalking through the grass;</span><br />
Where is he walking now, O where?<br />
<br />
What of his power who is here<br />
Enclosed within the sepulchre?<br />
To friends an eager sword of joy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A shield to nestle underneath.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>To foes whose love is to destroy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A stumbling block, a hidden death;</span><br />

Like sky-born dewy gossamer?<br />
To friends the ever-sought desire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hope achieved, the loving cup;</span><br />
To foes an unassaulted fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A furnace withering them up.</span><br />
Where is he shining now, O where?<br />
<br />
What of the head that breathed so here<br />
And the hair beloved so, is it sere;<br />
To friends a shadow shedding stars,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like blessings, from the upper deep;</span><br />
To foes a poisoned tree that mars<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Men's lives thereunder laid asleep.</span><br />
Where does it blossom now, O where?<br />
<br />
He lives, is living everywhere,<br />
Where human hearts are, he is there.<br />
To friends a soul of certainty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That love though lost is more than none.</span><br />
To foes an inability<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To say, "We slew him, we alone,</span><br />
His soul is here, we slew him here."<br />

THE UNFORGOTTEN<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a cave beneath the throne of grace<br />
Where these have honoured and remembered place;<br />
Strong hairy men, huge-jawed, with wiry limbs,<br />
Half hid in mist, the heroes of old times.<br />
They lie among the pots and flints and beads<br />
Their friends once buried with them as the needs<br />
Of the after-life, to hunt with and to slay with,<br />
And flay and cook, or in repose to play with.<br />
Here he who shaped the flint and bound to axe<br />
And arrow first; who made the thread of flax<br />
And hemp to weave; and he who to the plough<br />
Harnessed and tamed the bull and milked the cow;<br />
Who taught to bake and grind and till the seed<br />
Of corn sufficient for the future's need;<br />
And he who said: "These are my children, these;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
My blood between them and their enemies;<br />
For when I age and cannot win my meat,<br />
They shall become new head and hands and feet";<br />
And he who said: "Let none of our tribe die<br />
Slain by ourselves with violence. For why,<br />
Our foes are plentiful, our friends are few,<br />
Our living scarce. All may have work to do,<br />
As hunting, warring, digging for the strong,<br />
Or potting, cooking, weaving for the young,<br />
The old, the weak, yet for adornment skilled"&mdash;<br />
Too early born and by his brethren killed.<br />
Here he who dreamed a strange dream in the night,<br />
And from his rushes springing swat with fright,<br />
But thought and said with opened eyes, "'Tis beauty,"<br />
And terror left him. Those who spoke of duty,<br />
Mercy and truth, and taught the undying soul,<br />
And many more. And many a grunt and growl<br />
They give in friendly dreams; when haunches quiver<br />
And nostrils widen, and hands do twitch and shiver.<br />
And often one awakes, and blinks, half speaks,<br />
And yawns and licks and blows upon his cheeks:<br />
<br />
Pure spirits laugh, and with a kindly eye<br />
The father views their rough-haired majesty.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As once in a gay park, l saw him stand i</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thousand eyes in vulgar wonder scanned</span><br />
His humps and hairy neck, and gazed their fill<br />
At his lank shanks and mocked with laughter shrill.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He never moved: and if his Eastern land</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flashed on his eye with stretches of hot sand,</span><br />
It wrung no mute appeal from his proud will.<br />
He blinked upon the rabble lazily;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And still some trace of majesty forlorn</span><br />
And a coarse grace remained: his head was high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though his gaunt flanks with a great mange were worn:</span><br />
There was not any yearning in his eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But on his lips and nostril infinite scorn.</span><br />

THE PANIC<br />
<br />
<br />
Pale in her evening silks she sat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That but a week had been my bride;</span><br />
Then, while the stars we wondered at,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without a word she left my side;</span><br />
Devious and silent as a bat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I watched her round the garden glide.</span><br />
<br />
Soon o'er the moonlit lawn she streamed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then floated idly down the glade;</span><br />
Now like a forest nymph she seemed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now like a light within a shade:</span><br />
She turned, and for a moment gleamed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And suddenly I saw her fade.</span><br />
<br />
I had been held in tranced stare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till she had vanished from my sight;</span><br />
Then did I start in wild despair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And followed fast in mad affright;</span><br />
What if herself a spirit were<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And had so soon rejoined the night?</span><br />

WINE AND WATER<br />
<br />
<br />
Old Noah he had an ostrich farm and fowls on the largest scale,<br />
He ate his egg with a ladle in an egg-cup big as a pail,<br />
And the soup he took was Elephant Soup and the fish he took was Whale,<br />
But they all were small to the cellar he took when he set out to sail,<br />
And Noah he often said to his wife when he sat down to dine,<br />
"I don't care where the water goes if it doesn't get into the wine."<br />
<br />
The cataract of the cliff of heaven fell blinding off the brink<br />
As if it would wash the stars away as suds go down a sink,<br />
The seven heavens came roaring down for the throats of hell to drink,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
And Noah he cocked his eye and said, "It looks like rain, I think,<br />
The water has drowned the Matterhorn as deep as a Mendip mine,<br />
But I don't care where the water goes if it doesn't get into the wine."<br />
<br />
But Noah he sinned, and we have sinned; on tipsy feet we trod,<br />
Till a great big black teetotaller was sent to us for a rod,<br />
And you can't get wine at a P.S.A., or chapel, or Eisteddfod,<br />
But the Curse of Water has come again because of the wrath of God,<br />
And water is on the Bishop's board and the Higher Thinker's shrine,<br />
But I don't care where the water goes if it doesn't get into the wine.<br />

THE ROLLING ENGLISH ROAD<br />
<br />
<br />
Before the Roman came to Rye or out of Severn strode,<br />
The rolling English drunkard made the rolling English road.<br />
A reeling road, a rolling road, that rambles round the shire,<br />
And after him the parson ran, the sexton and the squire;<br />
A merry road, a mazy road, and such as we did tread,<br />
The night we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.<br />
<br />
I knew no harm of Bonaparte and plenty of the Squire,<br />
And for to fight the Frenchman I did not much desire;<br />
But I did bash their bagginets because they came arrayed<br />
To straighten out the crooked road an English drunkard made,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
When you and I went down the lane with ale-mugs in our hands,<br />
The night we went to Glastonbury by way of Goodwin Sands.<br />
<br />
His sins they were forgiven him; or why do flowers run<br />
Behind him; and the hedges all strengthening in the sun?<br />
The wild thing went from left to right and knew not which was which,<br />
But the wild rose was above him when they found him in the ditch.<br />
God pardon us, nor harden us: we did not see so clear<br />
The night we went to Bannockburn by way of Brighton Pier.<br />
<br />
My friends, we will not go again or ape an ancient rage,<br />
Or stretch the folly of our youth to be the shame of age,<br />
But walk with clearer eyes and ears this path that wandereth,<br />
And see undrugged in evening light the decent inn of death;<br />
But there is good news yet to hear and fine things to be seen,<br />
Before we go to Paradise by way of Kensal Green.<br />

THE DONKEY<br />
<br />
<br />
When fishes flew and forests walked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And figs grew upon thorn,</span><br />
Some moment when the moon was blood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then surely I was born;</span><br />
<br />
With monstrous head and sickening cry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ears like errant wings,</span><br />
The devil's walking parody<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On all four-footed things.</span><br />
<br />
The tattered outlaw of the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of ancient crooked will;</span><br />
Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I keep my secret still.</span><br />
<br />
Fools! For I also had my hour;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One far fierce hour and sweet:</span><br />
There was a shout about my ears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And palms before my feet.</span><br />

THE SECRET PEOPLE<br />
<br />
<br />
Smile at us, pay us, pass us; but do not quite forget,<br />
For we are the people of England, that never has spoken yet.<br />
There is many a fat farmer that drinks less cheerfully,<br />
There is many a free French peasant who is richer and sadder than we.<br />
There are no folk in the whole world so helpless or so wise.<br />
There is hunger in our bellies, there is laughter in our eyes;<br />
You laugh at us and love us, both mugs and eyes are wet:<br />
Only you do not know us. For we have not spoken yet.<br />
<br />
The fine French kings came over in a nutter of flags and dames.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
We liked their smiles and battles, but we never could say their names.<br />
The blood ran red to Bosworth and the high French lords went down;<br />
There was naught but a naked people under a naked crown.<br />
And the eyes of the King's Servants turned terribly every way,<br />
And the gold of the King's Servants rose higher every day.<br />
They burnt the homes of the shaven men, that had been quaint and kind,<br />
Till there was no bed in a monk's house, nor food that man could find.<br />
The inns of God where no man paid, that were the wall of the weak,<br />
The King's Servants ate them all. And still we did not speak.<br />
<br />
And the face of the King's Servants grew greater than the King:<br />
He tricked them, and they trapped him, and stood round him in a ring.<br />
The new grave lords closed round him, that had eaten the abbey's fruits,<br />
And the men of the new religion, with their Bibles in their boots,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
We saw their shoulders moving, to menace or discuss,<br />
And some were pure and some were vile; but none took heed of us.<br />
We saw the King as they killed him, and his face was proud and pale;<br />
And a few men talked of freedom, while England talked of ale.<br />
<br />
A war that we understood not came over the world and woke<br />
Americans, Frenchmen, Irish; but we knew not the things they spoke.<br />
They talked about rights and nature and peace and the people's reign:<br />
And the squires, our masters, bade us fight; and never scorned us again.<br />
Weak if we be for ever, could none condemn us then;<br />
Men called us serfs and drudges; men knew that we were men.<br />
In foam and flame at Trafalgar, on Albuera plains,<br />
We did and died like lions, to keep ourselves in chains,<br />
We lay in living ruins; firing and fearing not<br />
The strange fierce face of the Frenchmen who knew for what they fought,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
And the man who seemed to be more than man we strained against and broke;<br />
And we broke our own rights with him. And still we never spoke.<br />
<br />
Our path of glory ended; we never heard guns again.<br />
But the squire seemed struck in the saddle; he was foolish, as if in pain<br />
He leaned on a staggering lawyer, he clutched a cringing Jew,<br />
He was stricken; it may be, after all, he was stricken at Waterloo.<br />
Or perhaps the shades of the shaven men, whose spoil is in his house,<br />
Come back in shining shapes at last to spoil his last carouse <i>i</i><br />
We only know the last sad squires ride slowly towards the sea,<br />
And a new people takes the land: and still it is not we.<br />
<br />
They have given us into the hands of the new unhappy lords,<br />
Lords without anger and honour, who dare not carry their swords.<br />
They fight by shuffling papers; they have bright dead alien eyes;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
They look at our labour and laughter as a tired man looks at flies.<br />
And the load of their loveless pity is worse than the ancient wrongs,<br />
Their doors are shut in the evening; and they know no songs.<br />
<br />
We hear men speaking for us of new laws strong and sweet,<br />
Yet is there no man speaketh as we speak in the street.<br />
It may be we shall rise the last as Frenchmen rose the first,<br />
Our wrath come after Russia's wrath and our wrath be the worst.<br />
It may be we are meant to mark with our riot and our rest<br />
God's scorn for all men governing. It may be beer is best.<br />
But we are the people of England; and we have not spoken yet.<br />
Smile at us, pay us, pass us. But do not quite forget.<br />

FROM THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE HORSE<br />
<br />
<br />
Far northward and far westward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The distant tribes drew nigh,</span><br />
Plains beyond plains, fell beyond fell,<br />
That a man at sunset sees so well,<br />
And the tiny coloured towns that dwell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the comers of the sky.</span><br />
<br />
But dark and thick as thronged the host,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With drum and torch and blade,</span><br />
The still-eyed King sat pondering,<br />
As one that watches a live thing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The scoured chalk; and he said,</span><br />
<br />
"Though I give this land to Our Lady,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That helped me in Athelney,</span><br />
Though lordlier trees and lustier sod<br />
And happier hills hath no flesh trod<br />
Than the garden of the Mother of God<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Between Thames side and the sea,</span><br />
<br />
"I know that weeds shall grow in it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Faster than men can burn;</span><br />
And though they scatter now and go,<br />
In some far century, sad and slow,<br />
I have a vision, and I know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The heathen shall return.</span><br />
<br />
"They shall not come with warships,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They shall not waste with brands,</span><br />
But books be all their eating,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And ink be on their hands.</span><br />
<br />
"Not with the humour of hunters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or savage skill in war,</span><br />
But ordering all things with dead words,<br />
Strings shall they make of beasts and birds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And wheels of wind and star.</span><br />
<br />
"They shall come mild as monkish clerks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With many a scroll and pen;</span><br />
And backward shall ye turn and gaze,<br />
Desiring one of Alfred's days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When pagans still were men.</span><br />
<br />
"The dear sun dwarfed of dreadful suns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like fiercer flowers on stalk,</span><br />
Earth lost and little like a pea<br />
In high heaven's towering forestry,<br />
&mdash;These be the small weeds ye shall see<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Crawl, covering the chalk.</span><br />
<br />
"But though they bridge St. Mary's sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or steal St. Michael's wing&mdash;Though</span><br />
they rear marvels over us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Greater than great Vergilius</span><br />
Wrought for the Roman king;<br />
<br />
"By this sign you shall know them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The breaking of the sword,</span><br />
And Man no more a free knight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That loves or hates his lord.</span><br />
<br />
"Yea, this shall be the sign of them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sign of the dying fire;</span><br />
And Man made like a half-wit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That knows not of his sire.</span><br />
<br />
"What though they come with scroll and pen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And grave as a shaven clerk,</span><br />
By this sign you shall know them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That they ruin and make dark;</span><br />
<br />
"By all men bond to Nothing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Being slaves without a lord,</span><br />
By one blind idiot world obeyed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Too blind to be abhorred;</span><br />
<br />
"By terror and the cruel tales<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of curse in bone and kin,</span><br />
By weird and weakness winning,<br />
Accursed from the beginning,<br />
By detail of the sinning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And denial of the sin;</span><br />
<br />
"By thought a crawling ruin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By life a leaping mire,</span><br />
By a broken heart in the breast of the world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the end of the world's desire;</span><br />
<br />
"By God and man dishonoured,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By death and life made vain,</span><br />
Know ye the old barbarian,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The barbarian come again again&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"When is great talk of trend and tide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And wisdom and destiny,</span><br />
Hail that undying heathen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That is sadder than the sea.</span><br />
<br />
"In what wise men shall smite him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or the Cross stand up again,</span><br />
Or charity, or chivalry,<br />
My vision saith not; and I see<br />
No more; but now ride doubtfully<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the battle of the plain."</span><br />
<br />
And the grass-edge of the great down<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was clean cut as a lawn,</span><br />
While the levies thronged from near and far,<br />
From the warm woods of the western star,<br />
And the King went out to his last war<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On a tall grey horse at dawn.</span><br />
<br />
And news of his far-off fighting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Came slowly and brokenly</span><br />
From the land of the East Saxons,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From the sunrise and the sea,</span><br />
<br />
From the plains of the white sunrise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sad St. Edmund's crown,</span><br />
Where the pools of Essex pale and gleam<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Out beyond London Town&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
In mighty and doubtful fragments,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like faint or fabled wars,</span><br />
Climbed the old hills of his renown,<br />
Where the bald brow of White Horse Down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is close to the cold stars.</span><br />
<br />
But away in the eastern places<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The wind of death walked high,</span><br />
And a raid was driven athwart the raid,<br />
The sky reddened and the smoke swayed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the tall grey horse went by.</span><br />
<br />
The gates of the great river<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were breached as with a barge,</span><br />
The walls sank crowded, say the scribes,<br />
And high towers populous with tribes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seemed leaning from the charge.</span><br />
<br />
Smoke like rebellious heavens rolled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Curled over coloured flames,</span><br />
Billowed in monstrous purple dreams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the mighty pools of Thames.</span><br />
<br />
Loud was the war on London wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And loud in London gates,</span><br />
And loud the sea-kings in the cloud<br />
Broke through their dreaming gods, and loud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cried on their dreadful fates.</span><br />
<br />
And all the while on White Horse Hill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The horse lay long and wan,</span><br />
The turf crawled and the fungus crept,<br />
And the little sorrel, while all men slept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unwrought the work of man.</span><br />
<br />
With velvet finger, velvet foot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The fierce soft mosses then</span><br />
Crept on the large white commonweal<br />
All folk had striven to strip and peel,<br />
And the grass, like a great green witch's wheel,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unwound the toils of men.</span><br />
<br />
And clover and silent thistle throve,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And buds burst silently,</span><br />
With little care for the Thames Valley<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or what things there might be&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
That away on the widening river,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the eastern plains for crown</span><br />
Stood up in the pale purple sky<br />
One turret of smoke like ivory;<br />
And the smoke changed and the wind went by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the King took London Town.</span><br />

THE OLD WOMAN OF THE ROADS<br />
<br />
<br />
O, to have a little house!<br />
To own the hearth and stool and all!<br />
The heaped up sods upon the fire<br />
The pile of turf again' the wall!<br />
<br />
To have a clock with weights and chains,<br />
And pendulum swinging up and down!<br />
A dresser filled with shining delph,<br />
Speckled with white and blue and brown!<br />
<br />
I could be busy all the day<br />
Cleaning and sweeping hearth and floor,<br />
And fixing on their shelf again<br />
My white and blue and speckled store!<br />
<br />
I could be quiet there at night<br />
Beside the fire and by myself,<br />
Sure of a bed, and loth to leave<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
The ticking clock and shining delph!<br />
<br />
Och! but I'm weary of mist and dark,<br />
And roads where there's never a house or bush,<br />
And tired I am of bog and road,<br />
And the crying wind and the lonesome hush!<br />
<br />
<br />
And I am praying to God on high,<br />
And I am praying Him night and day,<br />
For a little house&mdash;a house of my own&mdash;Out<br />
of the wind's and rain's way.<br />

AUTUMN EVENING<br />
<br />
<br />
The shadows flickering, the daylight dying,<br />
And I upon the old red sofa lying,<br />
The great brown shadows leaping up the wall,<br />
The sparrows twittering; and that is all.<br />
<br />
I thought to send my soul to far-off lands,<br />
Where fairies scamper on the windy sands,<br />
Or where the autumn rain comes drumming down<br />
On huddled roofs in an enchanted town.<br />
<br />
But O my sleepy soul, it will not roam,<br />
It is too happy and too warm at home:<br />
With just the shadows leaping up the wall,<br />
The sparrows twittering; and that is all.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A Butterfly;</span><br />
That on a rough, hard rock<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Happy can lie;</span><br />
Friendless and all alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On this unsweetened stone.</span><br />
<br />
Now let my bed be hard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No care take I;</span><br />
I'll make my joy like this<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Small Butterfly;</span><br />
Whose happy heart has power<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To make a stone a flower.</span><br />

THE EAST IN GOLD<br />
<br />
<br />
Somehow this world is wonderful at times,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As it has been from early morn in May;</span><br />
Since I first heard the cock-a-doodle-do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Timekeeper on green farms&mdash;at break of day.</span><br />
<br />
Soon after that I heard ten thousand birds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which made me think an angel brought a bin</span><br />
Of golden grain, and none was scattered yet&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To rouse those birds to make that merry din.</span><br />
<br />
I could not sleep again, for such wild cries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And went out early into their green world;</span><br />
And then I saw what set their little tongues<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To scream for joy&mdash;they saw the East in gold.</span><br />

THE HAPPY CHILD<br />
<br />
<br />
I saw this day sweet flowers grow thick&mdash;<br />
But not one like the child did pick.<br />
<br />
I heard the packhounds in green park&mdash;<br />
But no dog like the child heard bark.<br />
<br />
I heard this day bird after bird&mdash;But<br />
not one like the child has heard.<br />
<br />
A hundred butterflies saw I&mdash;But<br />
not one like the child saw fly.<br />
<br />
I saw the horses roll in grass&mdash;<br />
But no horse like the child saw pass.<br />
<br />
My world this day has lovely been&mdash;<br />
But not like what the child has seen.<br />

A GREAT TIME<br />
<br />
<br />
Sweet Chance, that led my steps abroad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the town, where wild flowers grow&mdash;</span><br />
A rainbow and a cuckoo, Lord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How rich and great the times are now!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Know, all ye sheep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">And cows, that keep</span><br />
On staring that I stand so long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In grass that's wet from heavy rain&mdash;</span><br />
A rainbow and a cuckoo's song<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May never come together again;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">May never come</span><br />

THE WHITE CASCADE<br />

What happy mortal sees that mountain now,<br />
The white cascade that's shining on its brow;<br />
<br />
The white cascade that's both a bird and star,<br />
That has a ten-mile voice and shines as far?<br />
<br />
Though I may never leave this land again,<br />
Yet every spring my mind must cross the main<br />
<br />
To hear and see that water-bird and star<br />
That on the mountain sings, and shines so far.<br />

IN MAY<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I will spend the livelong day<br />
With Nature in this month of May;<br />
And sit beneath the trees, and share<br />
My bread with birds whose homes are there;<br />
While cows lie down to eat, and sheep<br />
Stand to their necks in grass so deep;<br />
While birds do sing with all their might,<br />
As though they felt the earth in flight.<br />
This is the hour I dreamed of, when<br />
I sat surrounded by poor men;<br />
And thought of how the Arab sat<br />
Alone at evening, gazing at<br />
The stars that bubbled in clear skies;<br />
<br />
And of young dreamers, when their eyes<br />
Enjoyed methought a precious boon<br />
In the adventures of the Moon<br />
Whose light, behind the Clouds' dark bars,<br />
Searched for her stolen flocks of stars.<br />
When I, hemmed in by wrecks of men,<br />
Thought of some lonely cottage then,<br />
Full of sweet books; and miles of sea,<br />
With passing ships, in front of me;<br />
And having, on the other hand,<br />
A flowery, green, bird-singing land.<br />

THUNDERSTORMS<br />

<br />
My mind has thunderstorms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That brood for heavy hours:</span><br />
Until they rain me words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My thoughts are drooping flowers</span><br />
And sulking, silent birds.<br />
<br />
Yet come, dark thunderstorms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And brood your heavy hours;</span><br />
For when you rain me words<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My thoughts are dancing flowers</span><br />
And joyful singing birds.<br />

SWEET STAY-AT-HOME<br />

<br />
Sweet Stay-at-Home, sweet Well-content,<br />
Thou knowest of no strange continent:<br />
Thou hast not felt thy bosom keep<br />
A gentle motion with the deep;<br />
Thou hast not sailed in Indian seas,<br />
Where scent comes forth in every breeze.<br />
Thou hast not seen the rich grape grow<br />
For miles, as far as eyes can go;<br />
Thou hast not seen a summer's night<br />
When maids could sew by a worm's light;<br />
Nor the North Sea in spring send out<br />
Bright trees that like birds flit about<br />
In solid cages of white ice&mdash;<br />
Sweet Stay-at-Home, sweet Love-one-place.<br />
Thou hast not seen black fingers pick<br />
White cotton when the bloom is thick,<br />
Nor heard black throats in harmony;<br />
Nor hast thou sat on stones that lie<br />
Flat on the earth, that once did rise<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
To hide proud kings from common eyes.<br />
Thou hast not seen plains full of bloom<br />
Where green things had such little room<br />
They pleased the eye like fairer flowers&mdash;<br />
Sweet Stay-at-Home, all these long hours.<br />
Sweet Well-content, sweet Love-one-place,<br />
Sweet, simple maid, bless thy dear face;<br />
For thou hast made more homely stuff<br />
Nurture thy gentle self enough;<br />
I love thee for a heart that's kind&mdash;<br />
Not for the knowledge in thy mind.<br />

THE TREES<br />
<br />
<br />
I did not know your names and yet I saw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The handiwork of Beauty in your boughs,</span><br />
I worshipped as the Druids did, in awe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Feeling at Spring my pagan soul arouse</span><br />
To see your leaf-buds open to the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dull green moss upon your ragged girth,</span><br />
The hoary sanctity of your decay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Life and Death glimmering upon the Earth.</span><br />

IN THIS DARK HOUSE<br />
<br />
<br />
I shall come back to die<br />
From a far place at last<br />
After my life's carouse<br />
In the old bed to lie,<br />
Remembering the past<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this dark house.</span><br />
<br />
Because of a clock's chime<br />
In the long waste of night<br />
I shall awake and wait<br />
At that calm lonely time<br />
Each smell and sound and sight<br />
Mysterious and innate:<br />
Some shadow on the wall<br />
When curtains by the door<br />
Move in a draught of wind;<br />
Or else a light footfall<br />
In a near corridor;<br />
Even to feel the kind<br />
Caress of a cool hand<br />
Smoothing the draggled hair<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Back from my shrunken brow,<br />
And strive to understand<br />
The woman's presence there,<br />
And whence she came, and how.<br />
<br />
What gust of wind that night<br />
Shall mutter her lost name<br />
Through windows open wide,<br />
And twist the nickering light<br />
Of a sole candle's flame<br />
Smoking from side to side,<br />
Till the last spark it blows<br />
Sets a moth's wings aflare<br />
As the faint flame goes out?<br />
<br />
Some distant door may close;<br />
Perhaps a heavy chair<br />
On bare floors dragged about<br />
O'er the low ceiling sound,<br />
And the thin twig of a tree<br />
Knock on my window-pane<br />
Till all the night around<br />
Is listening with me,<br />
While like a noise of rain<br />
Leaves rustle in the wind.<br />
<br />
Then from the inner gloom<br />
The scratching of a mouse<br />
May echo down my mind<br />
And sound around the room<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this dark house.</span><br />
<br />
The vague scent of a flower,<br />
Smelt then in that warm air<br />
From gardens drifting in,<br />
May slowly overpower<br />
The vapid lavender,<br />
Till feebly I begin<br />
To count the scents I knew<br />
And name them one by one,<br />
And search the names for this.<br />
<br />
Dreams will be swift and few<br />
Ere that last night be done,<br />
And gradual silences<br />
In each long interim<br />
Of halting time awake<br />
Confuse all conscious sense.<br />
Shadows will grow more dim,<br />
And sound and scent forsake<br />
The dark ere dawn commence,<br />
<br />
In the new morning then,<br />
So fixed the stare and fast,<br />
The calm unseeing eye<br />
Will never close again.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">.&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .</span><br />

THE LISTENERS<br />
<br />
<br />
"Is there anybody there?" said the Traveller,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knocking on the moonlit door;</span><br />
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the forest's ferny floor:</span><br />
And a bird flew up out of the turret,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the Traveller's head:</span><br />
And he smote upon the door again a second time;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Is there anybody there?" he said.</span><br />
But no one descended to the Traveller;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No head from the leaf-fringed sill</span><br />
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where he stood perplexed and still.</span><br />
But only a host of phantom listeners<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That dwelt in the lone house then</span><br />
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To that voice from the world of men:</span><br />
Stood thronging the faint moon beams on the dark stair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That goes down to the empty hall,</span><br />
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the lonely traveller's call.</span><br />
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their stillness answering his cry,</span><br />
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Neath the starred and leafy sky;</span><br />
For he suddenly smote on the door, even<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Louder, and lifted his head:&mdash;</span><br />
"Tell them I came, and no one answered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I kept my word," he said.</span><br />
Never the least stir made the listeners,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though every word he spake</span><br />
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the one man left awake:</span><br />
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sound of iron on stone</span><br />
And how the silence surged softly backward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the plunging hoofs were gone.</span><br />

ARABIA<br />
<br />
<br />
Far are the shades of Arabia,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the Princes ride at noon,</span><br />
'Mid the verdurous vales and thickets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under the ghost of the moon;</span><br />
And so dark is that vaulted purple<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flowers in the forest rise</span><br />
And toss into blossom 'gainst the phantom stars<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pale in the noonday skies.</span><br />
<br />
Sweet is the music of Arabia<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In my heart, when out of dreams</span><br />
I still in the thin clear mirk of dawn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Descry her gliding streams;</span><br />
Hear her strange lutes on the green banks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ring loud with the grief and delight</span><br />
Of the dim-silked, dark-haired Musicians<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the brooding silence of night.</span><br />
<br />
They haunt me&mdash;her lutes and her forests;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
No beauty on earth I see<br />
But shadowed with that dream recalls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her loveliness to me.</span><br />
Still eyes look coldly upon me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cold voices whisper and say&mdash;</span><br />
"He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia,<br />
They have stolen his wits away."<br />

MUSIC<br />
<br />
<br />
When music sounds, gone is the earth I know,<br />
And all her lovely things even lovelier grow;<br />
Her flowers in vision flame, her forest trees<br />
Lift burdened branches, stilled with ecstasies.<br />
<br />
When music sounds, out of the water rise<br />
Naiads whose beauty dims my waking eyes,<br />
Rapt in strange dream burns each enchanted face,<br />
With solemn echoing stirs their dwelling-place.<br />
<br />
When music sounds, all that I was I am<br />
Ere to this haunt of brooding dust I came;<br />
And from Time's woods break into distant song<br />
The swift-winged hours, as I hasten along.<br />

THE SCRIBE<br />
<br />
<br />
What lovely things<br />
hand hath made,<br />
The smooth-plumed bird<br />
In its emerald shade,<br />
The seed of the grass,<br />
The speck of stone<br />
Which the wayfaring ant<br />
Stirs, and hastes on.<br />
<br />
Though I should sit<br />
By some tarn in Thy hills,<br />
Using its ink<br />
As the spirit wills<br />
To write of Earth's wonders<br />
Its live willed things,<br />
Flit would the ages<br />
On soundless wings<br />
Ere unto Z<br />
My pen drew nigh,<br />
Leviathan told,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
And the honey-fly;<br />
And still would remain<br />
My wit to try&mdash;<br />
My Myworn reeds broken.<br />
The dark tarn dry,<br />
All words forgotten&mdash;<br />
Thou, Lord, and I.<br />

THE GHOST<br />
<br />
<br />
"Who knocks?" "I, who was beautiful<br />
Beyond all dreams to restore,<br />
I from the roots of the dark thorn am hither,<br />
And knock on the door."<br />
<br />
"Who speaks?" "I&mdash;once was my speech<br />
Sweet as the bird's on the air,<br />
When echo lurks by the waters to heed;<br />
'Tis I speak thee fair."<br />
<br />
"Dark is the hour!" "Aye, and cold."<br />
"Lone is my house." "Ah, but mine?"<br />
"Sight, touch, lips, eyes gleamed in vain."<br />
"Long dead these to thine."<br />
<br />
Silence. Still faint on the porch<br />
Broke the flames of the stars.<br />
In gloom groped a hope-wearied hand<br />
Over keys, bolts, and bars.<br />
<br />
A face peered. All the grey night<br />
In chaos of vacancy shone;<br />
Nought but vast sorrow was there&mdash;<br />
The sweet cheat gone.<br />

CLEAR EYES<br />

Clear eyes so dim at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cheeks outlive their rose.</span><br />
Time, heedless of the past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No loving kindness knows;</span><br />
Chill unto mortal lip<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still Lethe flows.</span><br />
<br />
Griefs, too, but brief while stay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sorrow, being o'er,</span><br />
Its salt tears shed away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Woundeth the heart no more.</span><br />
Stealthily lave these waters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That solemn shore.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, then, sweet face burn on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While yet quick memory lives!</span><br />
And Sorrow, ere thou art gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Know that my heart forgives&mdash;</span><br />
Ere yet, grown cold in peace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It loves not, nor grieves.</span><br />

How will fare the world whose wonder<br />
Was the very proof of me?<br />
Memory fades, must the remembered<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Perishing be?</span><br />
<br />
Oh, when this my dust surrenders<br />
Hand, foot, lip to dust again,<br />
May those loved and loving faces<br />

May the rusting harvest hedgerow<br />
Still the Traveller's Joy entwine,<br />
And as happy children gather<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Posies once mine.</span><br />
<br />
Look thy last on all things lovely,<br />
Every hour. Let no night<br />
Seal thy sense in deathly slumber<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till to delight</span><br />

Very old are the brooks;<br />

When snow sleeps cold beneath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The azure skies</span><br />
Sing such a history<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of come and gone,</span><br />
Their every drop is as wise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As Solomon.</span><br />
<br />
Very old are we men;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our dreams are tales</span><br />
Told in dim Eden<br />

We wake and whisper awhile,<br />

Silence and sleep like fields<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Amaranth lie.</span><br />

BIRTHRIGHT<br />
<br />
<br />
Lord Rameses of Egypt sighed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because a summer evening passed;</span><br />
And little Ariadne cried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That summer fancy fell at last</span><br />
To dust; and young Verona died<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When beauty's hour was overcast.</span><br />
<br />
Theirs was the bitterness we know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because the clouds of hawthorn keep</span><br />
So short a state, and kisses go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To tombs unfathomably deep,</span><br />
While Rameses and Romeo<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And little Ariadne sleep.</span><br />

MOONLIT APPLES<br />
<br />
<br />
At the top of the house the apples are laid in rows,<br />
And the skylight lets the moonlight in, and those<br />
Apples are deep-sea apples of green. There goes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A cloud on the moon in the autumn night.</span><br />
<br />
A mouse in the wainscot scratches, and scratches, and then<br />
There is no sound at the top of the house of men<br />
Or mice; and the cloud is blown, and the moon again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dapples the apples with deep-sea light.</span><br />
<br />
They are lying in rows there, under the gloomy beams;<br />
On the sagging floor; they gather the silver streams<br />
Out of the moon, those moonlit apples of dreams,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quiet is the steep stair under.</span><br />
<br />
In the corridors under there is nothing but sleep,<br />
And stiller than ever on orchard boughs they keep<br />
Tryst with the moon, and deep is the silence, deep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On moon-washed apples of wonder.</span><br />

ODE TO REALITY<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O Real, O That Which Is,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beyond all earthly bliss</span><br />
My spirit prays to be at one with Thee;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Away from that which seems,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From unenduring dreams,</span><br />
From vain pursuits and vainer meeds set free.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How rosy to our eyes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The mists of error rise,</span><br />
The proud pavilions that we weave at will I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How glittering the ray</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of that illusive day,</span><br />
The hills how grand, the vales how green and still!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And how inviting yet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The service of deceit,</span><br />
Paid by the crowd that does not understand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Parents and friends and foes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All bowing down to those</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Who against Thee have lifted up their hand!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ah, but on whomsoever</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Amid such glib endeavour</span><br />
Thy light has shined in sudden sovereignty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He who has fallen and heard</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy spirit-searching word:</span><br />
<i>Why kick against the pricks? Why outrage Me?</i><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He can no longer stay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There in the easy way,</span><br />
No longer please himself with make-believe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No longer shape at will</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The forms of good and ill</span><br />
And what he shall reject and what receive.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor may he dwell content</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In self-aggrandisement,</span><br />
To the deep wrong of modern Mammon blind;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor can he drown his cares</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Among the doctrinaires,</span><br />
Who think by sowing hate to save mankind.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For every scheme of vision</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He sees as the condition</span><br />
Not of the truest only but the best&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The riches of all wealth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The beauty of Beauty's self&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
That on Thee and within Thee it should rest.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By Thee our bounds are set;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou madest us; and yet</span><br />
O Mother, when we strain to see Thy face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Still dost Thou tease our prying</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With masks and mystifying,</span><br />
Still hold us at arm's length from Thy embrace!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet would I rather in act</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Plough with the iron Fact</span><br />
And earn at least some harvest that is bread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than rich and popular</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In gay Imposture's car</span><br />
Dazzle mankind and leave them still unfed.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rather would I in thought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Miss all that I had sought,</span><br />
Still pining on Negation's desert isle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than with the current float</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In Pragmatism's boat</span><br />
Down to the fatal shore where sirens smile.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rather would I be thrown</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Against Thine altar-stone,</span><br />
Unsanctified, unpitied, unreprieved,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than in some other shrine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sup the priests' meat and wine,</span><br />
Taking the wages of a world deceived.<br />

RIOUPEROUX<br />

High and solemn mountains guard Riouperoux,<br />
&mdash;Small untidy village where the river drives a mill:<br />
Frail as wood anemones, white, and frail were you,<br />
And drooping a little, like the slender daffodil.<br />
<br />
Oh I will go to France again, and tramp the valley through,<br />
And I will change these gentle clothes for clog and corduroy,<br />
And work with the mill-hands of black Rioupéroux,<br />
And walk with you, and talk with you, like any other boy.<br />

WAR SONG OF THE SARACENS<br />
<br />
<br />
We are they who come faster than fate: we are they who ride early<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">or late:</span><br />
We storm at your ivory gate: Pale Kings of the Sunset, beware!<br />
Not on silk nor in samet we lie, not in curtained solemnity die<br />
Among women who chatter and cry, and children who mumble a prayer.<br />
But we sleep by the ropes of the camp, and we rise with a shout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and we tramp</span><br />
With the sun or the moon for a lamp, and the spray of the wind in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">our hair.</span><br />
<br />
From the lands, where the elephants are, to the forts of Merou<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and Balghar,</span><br />
Our steel we have brought and our star to shine on the ruins of Rum.<br />
We have marched from the Indus to Spain, and by God we will go<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">there again;</span><br />
We have stood on the shore of the plain where the Waters of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Destiny boom.</span><br />
A mart of destruction we made at Jalula where men were afraid,<br />
For death was a difficult trade, and the sword was a broker of doom;<br />
<br />
And the Spear was a Desert Physician who cured not a few of ambition,<br />
And drave not a few to perdition with medicine bitter and strong:<br />
And the shield was a grief to the fool and as bright as a desolate pool,<br />
And as straight as the rock of Stamboul when their cavalry thundered<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">along:</span><br />
For the coward was drowned with the brave when our battle sheered up<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">like a wave,</span><br />
And the dead to the desert we gave, and the glory to God in our song.<br />

THE OLD SHIPS<br />
<br />
<br />
I have seen old ships sail like swans asleep<br />
Beyond the village which men still call Tyre,<br />
With leaden age o'ercargoed, dipping deep<br />
For Famagusta and the hidden sun<br />
That rings black Cyprus with a lake of fire;<br />
And all those ships were certainly so old<br />
Who knows how oft with squat and noisy gun,<br />
Questing brown slaves or Syrian oranges,<br />
The pirate Genoese<br />
Hell-raked them till they rolled<br />
Blood, water, fruit and corpses up the hold.<br />
But now through friendly seas they softly run,<br />
Painted the mid-sea blue or shore-sea green,<br />
Still patterned with the vine and grapes in<br />
gold.<br />
<br />
But I have seen,<br />
Pointing her shapely shadows from the dawn<br />
And image tumbled on a rose-swept bay,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
A drowsy ship of some yet older day;<br />
And, wonder's breath indrawn,<br />
Thought I&mdash;who knows&mdash;who knows&mdash;but in that same<br />
(Fished up beyond <i>Ææa,</i> patched up new<br />
&mdash;Stern painted brighter blue&mdash;)<br />
That talkative, bald-headed seaman came<br />
(Twelve patient comrades sweating at the oar)<br />
From Troy's doom-crimson shore,<br />
And with great lies about his wooden horse<br />
Set the crew laughing, and forgot his course.<br />
<br />
It was so old a ship&mdash;who knows, who knows?<br />
&mdash;And yet so beautiful, I watched in vain<br />
To see the mast burst open with a rose,<br />
And the whole deck put on its leaves again.<br />
<br />

STILLNESS<br />
<br />
<br />
When the words rustle no more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the last work's done,</span><br />
When the bolt lies deep in the door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Fire, our Sun,</span><br />
Falls on the dark-laned meadows of the floor;<br />
<br />
When from the clock's last chime to the next chime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Silence beats his drum,</span><br />
And Space with gaunt grey eyes and her brother Time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wheeling and whispering come,</span><br />
She with the mould of form and he with the loom of rhyme:<br />
<br />
Then twittering out in the night my thought-birds flee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am emptied of all my dreams:</span><br />
I only hear Earth turning, only see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ether's long bankless streams,</span><br />
And only know I should drown if you laid not your hand on me.<br />

AREIYA<br />
<br />
<br />
This place was formed divine for love and us to dwell;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This house of brown stone built for us to sleep therein;</span><br />
Those blossoms haunt the rocks that we should see and smell;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those old rocks break the hill that we the heights should win.</span><br />
<br />
Those heights survey the sea that there our thoughts should sail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up the steep wall of wave to touch the Syrian sky:</span><br />
For us that sky at eve fades out of purple pale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pale as the mountain mists beneath our house that lie.</span><br />
<br />
In front of our small house are brown stone arches three;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behind it, the low porch where all the jasmine grows;</span><br />
Beyond it, red and green, the gay pomegranate tree;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Around it, like love's arms, the summer and the rose.</span><br />
<br />
Within it sat and wrote in minutes soft and few<br />
This worst and best of songs, one who loves it, and you.<br />

THE QUEEN'S SONG<br />
<br />
<br />
Had I the power<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To Midas given of old</span><br />
To touch a flower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And leave the petals gold</span><br />
I then might touch thy face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Delightful boy,</span><br />
And leave a metal grace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A graven joy.</span><br />
<br />
Thus would I slay,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ah, desperate device!</span><br />
The vital day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That trembles in thine eyes,</span><br />
And let the red lips close<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Which sang so well,</span><br />
And drive away the rose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To leave a shell.</span><br />
<br />
Then I myself,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Rising austere and dumb</span><br />
On the high shelf<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of my half-lighted room,</span><br />
Would place the shining bust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And wait alone,</span><br />
Until I was but dust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Buried unknown.</span><br />
<br />
Thus in my love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For nations yet unborn,</span><br />
I would remove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">From our two lives the morn,</span><br />
And muse on loveliness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In mine arm-chair,</span><br />
Content should Time confess<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">How sweet you were.</span><br />

BRUMANA<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh shall I never never be home again?<br />
Meadows of England shining in the rain<br />
Spread wide your daisied lawns: your ramparts green<br />
With briar fortify, with blossom screen<br />
Till my far morning&mdash;and O streams that slow<br />
And pure and deep through plains and playlands go,<br />
For me your love and all your kingcups store,<br />
And&mdash;dark militia of the southern shore,<br />
Old fragrant friends&mdash;preserve me the last lines<br />
Of that long saga which you sung me, pines,<br />
When, lonely boy, beneath the chosen tree<br />
I listened, with my eyes upon the sea.<br />
<br />
O traitor pines, you sang what life has found<br />
The falsest of fair tales.<br />
Earth blew a far-horn prelude all around,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
That native music of her forest home,<br />
While from the sea's blue fields and syren dales<br />
Shadows and light noon-spectres of the foam<br />
Riding the summer gales<br />
On aery viols plucked an idle sound.<br />
<br />
Hearing you sing, O trees,<br />
Hearing you murmur, "There are older seas,<br />
That beat on vaster sands,<br />
Where the wise snailfish move their pearly towers<br />
To carven rocks and sculptured promont'ries,"<br />
Hearing you whisper, "Lands<br />
Where blaze the unimaginable flowers."<br />
<br />
Beneath me in the valley waves the palm,<br />
Beneath, beyond the valley, breaks the sea;<br />
Beneath me sleep in mist and light and calm<br />
Cities of Lebanon, dream-shadow-dim,<br />
Where Kings of Tyre and Kings of Tyre did rule<br />
In ancient days in endless dynasty,<br />
And all around the snowy mountains swim<br />
Like mighty swans afloat in heaven's pool.<br />
<br />
But I will walk upon the wooded hill<br />
Where stands a grove, O pines, of sister pines,<br />
And when the downy twilight droops her wing<br />
And no sea glimmers and no mountain shines<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
My heart shall listen still.<br />
For pines are gossip pines the wide world through<br />
And full of runic tales to sigh or sing.<br />
<br />
'Tis ever sweet through pine to see the sky<br />
Mantling a deeper gold or darker blue.<br />
'Tis ever sweet to lie<br />
On the dry carpet of the needles brown,<br />
And though the fanciful green lizard stir<br />
And windy odours light as thistledown<br />
Breathe from the lavdanon and lavender,<br />
Half to forget the wandering and pain,<br />
Half to remember days that have gone by,<br />
And dream and dream that I am home again!<br />

Hail and farewell! I pass, and thou art gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So fast in fire the great boat beats the seas.</span><br />

But slowly fade, soft Island! Ah to know<br />

And there thy Prince's house, painted old rose,<br />

Load up with Asian snow his Coan wine?<br />

Behind a rock, thy harbour, whence a noise<br />

And from that little rock thy naked boys<br />

<br />
That old Greek day was all thy history:<br />

Farewell: this boat attends not such as thee:<br />

Farewell! But I who call upon thy caves<br />

THE GOLDEN JOURNEY TO SAMARKAND<br />
<br />
<br />
PROLOGUE<br />
<br />
<br />
We who with songs beguile your pilgrimage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And swear that Beauty lives though lilies die,</span><br />
We Poets of the proud old lineage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who sing to find your hearts, we know not why,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
What shall we tell you? Tales, marvellous tales<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of ships and stars and isles where good men rest,</span><br />
Where nevermore the rose of sunset pales,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And winds and shadows fall toward the West:</span><br />
<br />
And there the world's first huge white-bearded kings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In dim glades sleeping, murmur in their sleep,</span><br />
And closer round their breasts the ivy clings,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cutting its pathway slow and red and deep.</span><br />
<br />
And how beguile you? Death has no repose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Warmer and deeper than that Orient sand</span><br />
Which hides the beauty and bright faith of those<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who made the Golden Journey to Samarkand.</span><br />
<br />
And now they wait and whiten peaceably,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those conquerors, those poets, those so fair:</span><br />
They know time comes, not only you and I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the whole world shall whiten, here or there;</span><br />
<br />
When those long caravans that cross the plain<br />

When the great markets by the sea shut fast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All that calm Sunday that goes on and on:</span><br />

LA VIE CEREBRALE<br />
<br />
<br />
I am alone&mdash;alone;<br />
There is nothing&mdash;only I,<br />
And, when I will to die,<br />
All must be gone.<br />
<br />
Eternal thought in me<br />
Puts on the dress of time<br />
And builds a stage to mime<br />
Its listless tragedy.<br />
<br />
And in that dress of time<br />
And on that stage of space<br />
I place, change, and replace<br />
Life to a wilful rime.<br />
<br />
I summon at my whim<br />
All things that are, that were:<br />
The high incredible air,<br />
Where stars&mdash;my creatures&mdash;swim.<br />
<br />
I dream, and from my mind<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>The dead, the living come;<br />
I build a marble Rome,<br />
I give it to the wind.<br />
<br />
Athens and Babylon<br />
I breathe upon the night,<br />
Troy towers for my delight<br />
And crumbles stone by stone.<br />
<br />
I change with white and green<br />
The seasons hour by hour;<br />
I think&mdash;it is a flower,<br />
Think&mdash;and the flower has been.<br />
<br />
Men, women, things, a stream<br />
That wavers and flows by,<br />
A lonely dreamer, I<br />
Build and cast down the dream.<br />
<br />
And one day weary grown<br />
Of all my brain has wrought,<br />
I shall destroy my thought<br />
And I and all be gone.<br />

THE PIPES<br />
<br />
<br />
With the spring awaken other springs,<br />
Those swallows' wings are shadowed by other wings<br />
And another thrush behind that glad bird sings.<br />
<br />
A multitude are the flowers, but multitudes<br />
Blossom and waver and breathe from forgotten woods,<br />
And in silent places an older silence broods.<br />
<br />
With the spring long-buried springs in my heart awaken,<br />
Time takes the years, but the springs he has not taken,<br />
My thoughts with a boy's wild thoughts are mixed and shaken.<br />
<br />
And here amid inland fields by the down's green shoulder<br />
I remember an ancient sea and mountains older,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Older than all but time, skies sterner and colder.<br />
<br />
When the swift spring night on the sea and the mountains fell<br />
In the hush of the solemn hills I remember well<br />
The far pipes calling and the tale they had to tell.<br />
<br />
Sad was the tale, ah! sad beyond all saying<br />
The lament of the lonely pipes in the evening playing<br />
Lost in the glens, in the still, dark pines delaying.<br />
<br />
And now with returning spring I remember all,<br />
On southern fields those mountain shadows fall,<br />
Those wandering pipes in the downland evening call.<br />

SAY NOT THAT BEAUTY<br />
<br />
<br />
Say not that beauty is an idle thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gathered lightly as a wayside flower</span><br />
That on the trembling verges of the spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knows but the sweet survival of an hour.</span><br />
For 'tis not so. Through dedicated days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And foiled adventure of deliberate nights</span><br />
We lose and find and stumble in the ways<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lead to the far confluence of delights.</span><br />
Not with the earthly eye and fleshly ear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But lifted far above mortality,</span><br />
We see at last the eternal hills, and hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sighing of the universal sea;</span><br />
And kneeling breathless in the holy place<br />
We know immortal Beauty face to face.<br />

THE WAKERS<br />
<br />
<br />
The joyous morning ran and kissed the grass<br />
And drew his fingers through her sleeping hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cried, "Before thy flowers are well awake</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rise, and the lingering darkness from thee shake.</span><br />
<br />
"Before the daisy and the sorrel buy<br />
Their brightness back from that close-folding night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come, and the shadows from thy bosom shake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Awake from thy thick sleep, awake, awake!"</span><br />
<br />
Then the grass of that mounded meadow stirred<br />
Above the Roman bones that may not stir<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though joyous morning whispered, shouted, sang:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The grass stirred as that happy music rang.</span><br />
<br />
O, what a wondrous rustling everywhere!<br />
The steady shadows shook and thinned and died,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shining grass flashed brightness back for brightness,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sleep was gone, and there was heavenly lightness.</span><br />
<br />
As if she had found wings, light as the wind,<br />
The grass flew, bent with the wind, from east to west,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chased by one wild grey cloud, and flashing all</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her dews for happiness to hear morning call ...</span><br />
<br />
But even as I stepped out the brightness dimmed,<br />
I saw the fading edge of all delight.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sober morning waked the drowsy herds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there was the old scolding of the birds.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
THE BODY<br />
<br />
<br />
When I had dreamed and dreamed what woman's beauty was,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how that beauty seen from unseen surely flowed,</span><br />
I turned and dreamed again, but sleeping now no more:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My eyes shut and my mind with inward vision glowed.</span><br />
<br />
"I did not think!" I cried, seeing that wavering shape<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That steadied and then wavered, as a cherry bough in June</span><br />
Lifts and falls in the wind&mdash;each fruit a fruit of light;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then she stood as clear as an unclouded moon.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
As clear and still she stood, moonlike remotely near;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw and heard her breathe, I years and years away.</span><br />
Her light streamed through the years, I saw her clear and still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shape and spirit together mingling night with day.</span><br />
<br />
Water falling, falling with the curve of time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over green-hued rock, then plunging to its pool</span><br />
Far, far below, a falling spear of light;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Water falling golden from the sun but moonlike cool:</span><br />
<br />
Water has the curve of her shoulder and breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Water falls as straight as her body rose,</span><br />
Water her brightness has from neck to still feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Water crystal-cold as her cold body flows.</span><br />
<br />
But not water has the colour I saw when I dreamed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor water such strength has. I joyed to behold</span><br />
How the blood lit her body with lamps of fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made the flesh glow that like water gleamed cold.</span><br />
<br />
A flame in her arms and in each finger flame,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And flame in her bosom, flame above, below,</span><br />
The curve of climbing flame in her waist and her thighs;µ<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From foot to head did flame into red flame flow.</span><br />
<br />
I knew how beauty seen from unseen must rise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How the body's joy for more than body's use was made.</span><br />
I knew then how the body is the body of the mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how the mind's own fire beneath the cool skin played.</span><br />
<br />
O shape that once to have seen is to see evermore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Falling stream that falls to the deeps of the mind,</span><br />
Fire that once lit burns while aught burns in the world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Foot to head a flame moving in the spirit's wind!</span><br />
<br />
If these eyes could see what these eyes have not seen&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The inward vision clear&mdash;how should I look for</span><br />
Knowing that beauty's self rose visible in the world<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over age that darkens, and griefs that destroy?</span><br />

STONE TREES<br />
<br />
<br />
Last night a sword-light in the sky<br />
Flashed a swift terror on the dark.<br />
In that sharp light the fields did lie<br />
Naked and stone-like; each tree stood<br />
Like a tranced woman, bound and stark.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Far off the wood</span><br />
With darkness ridged the riven dark.<br />
<br />
The cows astonished stared with fear,<br />
And sheep crept to the knees of cows,<br />
And conies to their burrows slid,<br />
And rooks were still in rigid boughs,<br />
And all things else were still or hid.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From all the wood</span><br />
Came but the owl's hoot, ghostly, clear.<br />
<br />
In that cold trance the earth was held<br />
It seemed an age, or time was nought.<br />
Sure never from that stone-like field<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Sprang golden corn, nor from those chill<br />
Gray granite trees was music wrought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In all the wood</span><br />
Even the tall poplar hung stone still.<br />
<br />
It seemed an age, or time was none ...<br />
Slowly the earth heaved out of sleep<br />
And shivered, and the trees of stone<br />
Bent and sighed in the gusty wind,<br />
And rain swept as birds nocking sweep.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Far off the wood</span><br />
Rolled the slow thunders on the wind.<br />
<br />
From all the wood came no brave bird,<br />
No song broke through the close-fall'n night,<br />
Nor any sound from cowering herd:<br />
Only a dog's long lonely howl<br />
When from the window poured pale light.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And from the wood</span><br />
The hoot came ghostly of the owl.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
MORE THAN SWEET<br />
<br />
<br />
The noisy fire,<br />
The drumming wind,<br />
The creaking trees,<br />
And all that hum<br />
Of summer air<br />
And all the long inquietude<br />
Of breaking seas&mdash;<br />
<br />
Sweet and delightful are<br />
In loneliness.<br />
But more than these<br />
The quiet light<br />
From the morn's sun<br />
And night's astonished moon,<br />
Falling gently upon breaking seas.<br />
<br />
Such quietness<br />
Another beauty is&mdash;<br />
Ah, and those stars<br />
So gravely still<br />
More than light, than beauty pour<br />
Upon the strangeness<br />
Of the heart's breaking seas.<br />
<br />

<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
WAKING<br />
<br />
<br />
Lying beneath a hundred seas of sleep<br />
With all those heavy waves flowing over me,<br />
And I unconscious of the rolling night<br />
Until, slowly, from deep to lesser deep<br />
Risen, I felt the wandering seas no longer cover me<br />
But only air and light ...<br />
<br />
It was a sleep<br />
So dark and so bewilderingly deep<br />
That only death's were deeper or completer,<br />
And none when I awoke stranger or sweeter.<br />
Awake, the strangeness still hung over me<br />
As I with far-strayed senses stared at the light.<br />
<br />
I&mdash;and who was I?<br />
Saw&mdash;oh, with what unaccustomed eye!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
The room was strange and everything strange<br />
Like a strange room entered by wild moonlight;<br />
And yet familiar as the light swept over me<br />
And I rose from the night.<br />
<br />
Strange&mdash;yet stranger I.<br />
And as one climbs from water up to land<br />
Fumbling for weedy steps with foot and hand,<br />
So I for yesterdays whereon to climb<br />
To this remote and new-struck isle of time.<br />
But I found not myself nor yesterday&mdash;<br />
<br />
Until, slowly, from deep to lesser deep<br />
Risen, I felt the seas no longer over me<br />
But only air and light.<br />
Yes, like one clutching at a ring I heard<br />
The household noises as they stirred,<br />
And holding fast I wondered, What were they?<br />
<br />
I felt a strange hand lying at my side,<br />
Limp and cool. I touched it and knew it mine.<br />
A murmur, and I remembered how the wind died<br />
In the near aspens. Then<br />
Strange things were no more strange.<br />
I travelled among common thoughts again;<br />
<br />
And felt the new-forged links of that strong chain<br />
That binds me to myself, and this to-day<br />
To yesterday. I heard it rattling near<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
With a no more astonished ear.<br />
And I had lost the strangeness of that sleep,<br />
No more the long night rolled its great seas over me.<br />
<br />
&mdash;O, too anxious I!<br />
For in this press of things familiar<br />
I have lost all that clung<br />
Round me awaking of strangeness and such sweetness.<br />
Nothing now is strange<br />
Except the man that woke and then was I.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
THE CHAIR<br />
<br />
<br />
The chair was made<br />
By hands long dead,<br />
Polished by many bodies sitting there,<br />
Until the wood-lines flowed as clean as waves.<br />
<br />
Mine sat restless there,<br />
Or propped to stare<br />
Hugged the low kitchen with fond eyes<br />
Or tired eyes that looked at nothing at all.<br />
<br />
Or watched from the smoke rise<br />
The flame's snake-eyes,<br />
Up the black-bearded chimney leap;<br />
Then on my shoulder my dull head would drop.<br />
<br />
And half asleep<br />
I heard her creep&mdash;Her<br />
never-singing lips shut fast,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Fearing to wake me by a careless breath.<br />
<br />
Then, at last,<br />
My lids upcast,<br />
Our eyes met, I smiled and she smiled,<br />
And I shut mine again and truly slept.<br />
<br />
Was I that child<br />
Fretful, sick, wild?<br />
Was that you moving soft and soft<br />
Between the rooms if I but played at sleep?<br />
<br />
Or if I laughed,<br />
Talked, cried, or coughed,<br />
You smiled too, just perceptibly,<br />
Or your large kind brown eyes said, O poor boy!<br />
<br />
From the fireside I<br />
Could see the narrow sky<br />
Through the barred heavy window panes,<br />
Could hear the sparrows quarrelling round the<br />
lilac;<br />
<br />
And hear the heavy rains<br />
Choking in the roof-drains:&mdash;<br />
Else of the world I nothing heard<br />
Or nothing remember now. But most I loved<br />
<br />
To watch when you stirred<br />
Busily like a bird<br />
At household doings; with hands floured<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Mixing a magic with your cakes and tarts.<br />
<br />
O into me, sick, froward,<br />
Yourself you poured;<br />
In all those days and weeks when I<br />
Sat, slept, woke, whimpered, wondered and slept again.<br />
<br />
Now but a memory<br />
To bless and harry me<br />
Remains of you still swathed with care;<br />
Myself your chief care, sitting by the hearth<br />
<br />
Propped in the pillowed chair,<br />
Following you with tired stare,<br />
And my hand following the wood lines<br />
By dead hands smoothed and followed many years.<br />
<br />

THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES<br />
<br />
<br />
And now, while the dark vast earth shakes and rocks<br />
In this wild dream-like snare of mortal shocks,<br />
How look (I muse) those cold and solitary stars<br />
On these magnificent, cruel wars?&mdash;Venus,<br />
that brushes with her shining lips<br />
(Surely!) the wakeful edge of the world and mocks<br />
With hers its all ungentle wantonness?&mdash;Or<br />
the large moon (pricked by the spars of ships<br />
Creeping and creeping in their restlessness),<br />
The moon pouring strange light on things more strange,<br />
Looks she unheedfully on seas and lands<br />
Trembling with change and fear of counter-change?<br />
<br />
O, not earth trembles, but the stars, the stars!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
The sky is shaken and the cool air is quivering.<br />
I cannot look up to the crowded height<br />
And see the fair stars trembling in their light,<br />
For thinking of the starlike spirits of men<br />
Crowding the earth and with great passion quivering:&mdash;<br />
Stars quenched in anger and hate, stars sick with pity.<br />
I cannot look up to the naked skies<br />
Because a sorrow on dark midnight lies,<br />
Death, on the living world of sense;<br />
Because on my own land a shadow lies<br />
That may not rise;<br />
Because from bare grey hillside and rich city<br />
Streams of uncomprehending sadness pour,<br />
Thwarting the eager spirit's pure intelligence...<br />
How look (I muse) those cold and solitary stars<br />
On these magnificent, cruel wars?<br />
<br />
Stars trembled in broad heaven, faint with pity.<br />
An hour to dawn I looked. Beside the trees<br />
Wet mist shaped other trees that branching rose,<br />
Covering the woods and putting out the stars.<br />
There was no murmur on the seas,<br />
No wind blew&mdash;only the wandering air that grows<br />
With dawn, then murmurs, sighs,<br />
And dies.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
The mist climbed slowly, putting out the stars,<br />
And the earth trembled when the stars were gone;<br />
And moving strangely everywhere upon<br />
The trembling earth, thickened the watery mist.<br />
<br />
And for a time the holy things are veiled.<br />
England's wise thoughts are swords; her quiet hours<br />
Are trodden underfoot like wayside flowers,<br />
And every English heart is England's wholly.<br />
In starless night<br />
A serious passion streams the heaven with light.<br />
A common beating is in the air&mdash;<br />
The heart of England throbbing everywhere.<br />
And all her roads are nerves of noble thought,<br />
And all her people's brain is but her brain;<br />
And all her history, less her shame,<br />
Is part of her requickened consciousness.<br />
Her courage rises clean again.<br />
<br />
Even in victory there hides defeat;<br />
The spirit's murdered though the body survives,<br />
Except the cause for which a people strives<br />
Burn with no covetous, foul heat.<br />
Fights she against herself who infamously draws<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
The sword against man's secret spiritual laws,<br />
But thou, England, because a bitter heel<br />
Hath sought to bruise the brain, the sensitive will,<br />
The conscience of the world,<br />
For this, England, art risen, and shalt fight<br />
Purely through long profoundest night,<br />
<br />
Making their quarrel thine who are grieved like thee;<br />
And (if to thee the stars yield victory)<br />
Tempering their hate of the great foe that hurled<br />
Vainly her strength against the conscience of the world.<br />
<br />
I looked again, or dreamed I looked, and saw<br />
The stars again and all their peace again.<br />
The moving mist had gone, and shining still<br />
The moon went high and pale above the hill.<br />
Not now those lights were trembling in the vast<br />
Ways of the nervy heaven, nor trembled earth:<br />
Profound and calm they gazed as the soft-shod hours passed.<br />
And with less fear (not with less awe,<br />
Remembering, England, all the blood and pain)<br />
How look, I cried, you stern and solitary stars<br />
On these disastrous wars!<br />

SHADOWS<br />
<br />
<br />
The shadow of the lantern on the wall,<br />
The lantern hanging from the twisted beam,<br />
The eye that sees the lantern, shadow and all.<br />
<br />
The crackle of the sinking fire in the grate,<br />
The far train, the slow echo in the coombe,<br />
The ear that hears fire, train and echo and all.<br />
<br />
The loveliness that is the secret shape<br />
Of once-seen, sweet and oft-dreamed loveliness,<br />
The brain that builds shape, memory, dream and all ...<br />
<br />
A white moon stares Time's thinning fabric through,<br />
And makes substantial insubstantial seem,<br />
And shapes immortal mortal as a dream;<br />
And eye and brain flicker as shadows do<br />
Restlessly dancing on a cloudy wall.<br />

"What do you hunt, Orion,<br />

TO LUCASTA ON GOING TO THE WARS&mdash;<br />
FOR THE FOURTH TIME<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter what's the cause,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What wrong they say we're righting,</span><br />
A curse for treaties, bonds and laws,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When we're to do the fighting!</span><br />
And since we lads are proud and true,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What else remains to do?</span><br />
<br />
Lucasta, when to France your man<br />
Returns his fourth time, hating war,<br />
Yet laughs as calmly as he can<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And flings an oath, but says no more,</span><br />
That is not courage, that's not fear&mdash;Lucasta<br />
he is Fusilier,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his pride sends him here.</span><br />
<br />
Let statesmen bluster, bark and bray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so decide who started</span><br />
This bloody war, and who's to pay<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he must be stout-hearted,</span><br />
Must sit and stake with quiet breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Playing at cards with Death.</span><br />
<br />
Don't plume yourself he fights for you;<br />
It is no courage, love or hate<br />
That lets us do the things we do;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It's pride that makes the heart so great;</span><br />
It is not anger, no, nor fear&mdash;Lucasta<br />
he's a Fusilier,<br />

NOT DEAD<br />
<br />

Walking through trees to cool my heat and pain,<br />
I know that David's with me here again.<br />
All that is simple, happy, strong, he is.<br />
Caressingly I stroke<br />
Rough bark of the friendly oak.<br />
A brook goes bubbling by: the voice is his.<br />
Turf burns with pleasant smoke;<br />
I laugh at chaffinch and at primroses.<br />

<br />
Christ of his gentleness<br />
Thirsting and hungering,<br />
Walked in the wilderness;<br />
Soft words of grace He spoke<br />
Unto lost desert-folk<br />

He held communion<br />
With the she-pelican<br />

Basilisk, cockatrice,<br />
Flocked to His homilies,<br />
With mail of dread device,<br />
With monstrous barbed stings,<br />

TO A BLACK GREYHOUND<br />
<br />
<br />
Shining black in the shining light,<br />
Inky black in the golden sun,<br />
Graceful as the swallow's flight,<br />
Light as swallow, winged one,<br />
Swift as driven hurricane,<br />
Double-sinewed stretch and spring,<br />
Muffled thud of flying feet&mdash;<br />
See the black dog galloping,<br />
Hear his wild foot-beat.<br />
<br />
See him lie when the day is dead,<br />
Black curves curled on the boarded floor.<br />
Sleepy eyes, my sleepy-head&mdash;<br />
Eyes that were aflame before.<br />
Gentle now, they burn no more;<br />
Gentle now and softly warm,<br />
With the fire that made them bright<br />
Hidden&mdash;as when after storm<br />
Softly falls the night.<br />

INTO BATTLE<br />
<br />
<br />
The naked earth is warm with Spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with green grass and bursting trees</span><br />
Leans to the sun's gaze glorying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quivers in the sunny breeze;</span><br />
And Life is Colour and Warmth and Light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a striving evermore for these;</span><br />
And he is dead who will not fight;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And who dies fighting has increase.</span><br />
<br />
The fighting man shall from the sun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Take warmth, and life from the glowing earth;</span><br />
Speed with the light-foot winds to run,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with the trees to newer birth;</span><br />
And find, when fighting shall be done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Great rest, and fullness after dearth.</span><br />
<br />
All the bright company of Heaven<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hold him in their high comradeship,</span><br />
The Dog-Star and the Sisters Seven,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They guide to valley and ridges' end.</span><br />
<br />
The kestrel hovering by day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the little owls that call by night,</span><br />
Bid him be swift and keen as they,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As keen of ear, as swift of sight.</span><br />
<br />
The blackbird sings to him, "Brother, brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If this be the last song you shall sing</span><br />
Sing well, for you may not sing another;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brother, sing."</span><br />
<br />
In dreary, doubtful, waiting hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before the brazen frenzy starts,</span><br />
The horses show him nobler powers;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O patient eyes, courageous hearts</span><br />
<br />
And when the burning moment breaks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all things else are out of mind,</span><br />
And only Joy of Battle takes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Him by the throat, and makes him blind</span><br />

Through joy and blindness he shall know,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That it be not the Destined Will.</span><br />
<br />
The thundering line of battle stands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the air Death moans and sings;</span><br />
But Day shall clasp him with strong hands,<br />

TO THE POET BEFORE BATTLE<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes:<br />
Thy lovely things must all be laid away;<br />
And thou, as others, must face the riven day<br />
Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums,<br />
Or bugles' strident cry.  When mere noise numbs<br />
The sense of being, the fear-sick soul doth sway,<br />
Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say<br />
Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs<br />
Of praise the little versemen joyed to take<br />
Shall be forgotten: then they must know we are,<br />
For all our skill in words, equal in might<br />
And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make<br />
The name of poet terrible in just war,<br />
And like a crown of honour upon the fight.<br />

SONG OF PAIN AND BEAUTY<br />
<br />
To M. M. S.<br />
<br />
<br />
O may these days of pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These wasted-seeming days,</span><br />
Somewhere reflower again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With scent and savour of praise,</span><br />
Draw out of memory all bitterness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of night with Thy sun's rays.</span><br />
<br />
And strengthen Thou in me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The love of men here found,</span><br />
And eager charity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That, out of difficult ground,</span><br />
Spring like flowers in barren deserts, or<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like light, or a lovely sound.</span><br />
<br />
A simpler heart than mine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might have seen beauty clear</span><br />
When I could see no sign<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Thee, but only fear.</span><br />
Strengthen me, make me to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy beauty always</span><br />

EVE<br />
<br />
<br />
Eve, with her basket, was<br />
Deep in the bells and grass,<br />
Wading in bells and grass<br />
Up to her knees,<br />
Picking a dish of sweet<br />
Berries and plums to eat,<br />
Down in the bells and grass<br />
Under the trees.<br />
<br />
Mute as a mouse in a<br />
Corner the cobra lay,<br />
Curled round a bough of the<br />
Cinnamon tall......<br />
Now to get even and<br />
Humble proud heaven and<br />
Now was the moment or<br />
Never at all.<br />
<br />
"Eva!" Each syllable<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Light as a flower fell,<br />
"Eva!" he whispered the<br />
Wondering maid,<br />
Soft as a bubble sung<br />
Out of a linnet's lung,<br />
Soft and most silverly<br />
"Eva!" he said.<br />
<br />
Picture that orchard sprite,<br />
Eve, with her body white,<br />
Supple and smooth to her<br />
Slim finger tips,<br />
Wondering, listening,<br />
Eve with a berry<br />
Half way to her lips.<br />
<br />
Oh had our simple Eve<br />
Seen through the make-believe!<br />
Had she but known the<br />
Pretender he was!<br />
Out of the boughs he came<br />
Whispering still her name<br />
Tumbling in twenty rings<br />
Into the grass.<br />
<br />
Here was the strangest pair<br />
In the world anywhere;<br />
Eve in the bells and grass<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
Kneeling, and he<br />
Telling his story low....<br />
Singing birds saw them go<br />
Down the dark path to<br />
The Blasphemous Tree.<br />
<br />
Oh what a clatter when<br />
Titmouse and Jenny Wren<br />
Saw him successful and<br />
Taking his leave!<br />
How the birds rated him,<br />
How they all hated him!<br />
How they all pitied<br />
Poor motherless' Eve!<br />
<br />
Picture her crying<br />
Outside in the lane,<br />
Eve, with no dish of sweet<br />
Berries and plums to eat,<br />
Haunting the gate of the<br />
Orchard in vain......<br />
Picture the lewd delight<br />
Under the hill to-night&mdash;<br />
"Eva!" the toast goes round,<br />
"Eva!" again.<br />

THE BULL<br />
<br />
<br />
See an old unhappy bull,<br />
Sick in soul and body both,<br />
Slouching in the undergrowth<br />
Of the forest beautiful,<br />
Banished from the herd he led,<br />
Bulls and cows a thousand head.<br />
<br />
Cranes and gaudy parrots go<br />
Up and down the burning sky;<br />
Tree-top cats purr drowsily<br />
In the dim-day green below;<br />
And troops of monkeys, nutting, some,<br />
All disputing, go and come;<br />
<br />
And things abominable sit<br />
Picking offal buck or swine,<br />
On the mess and over it<br />
Burnished flies and beetles shine,<br />
And spiders big as bladders lie<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Under hemlocks ten foot high;<br />
<br />
And a dotted serpent curled<br />
Round and round and round a tree,<br />
Yellowing its greenery,<br />
Keeps a watch on all the world,<br />
All the world and this old bull<br />
In the forest beautiful.<br />
<br />
Bravely by his fall he came:<br />
One he led, a bull of blood<br />
Newly come to lustihood,<br />
Fought and put his prince to shame,<br />
Snuffed and pawed the prostrate head<br />
Tameless even while it bled.<br />
<br />
There they left him, every one,<br />
Left him there without a lick,<br />
Left him for the birds to pick,<br />
Left him there for carrion,<br />
Vilely from their bosom cast<br />
Wisdom, worth and love at last.<br />
<br />
When the lion left his lair<br />
And roared his beauty through the hills,<br />
And the vultures pecked their quills<br />
And flew into the middle air,<br />
Then this prince no more to reign<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
Came to life and lived again,<br />
<br />
He snuffed the herd in far retreat,<br />
He saw the blood upon the ground,<br />
And snuffed the burning airs around<br />
Still with beevish odours sweet,<br />
While the blood ran down his head<br />
And his mouth ran slaver red.<br />
<br />
Pity him, this fallen chief,<br />
All his splendour, all his strength,<br />
All his body's breadth and length<br />
Dwindled down with shame and grief,<br />
Half the bull he was before,<br />
Bones and leather, nothing more.<br />
<br />
See him standing dewlap-deep<br />
In the rushes at the lake,<br />
Surly, stupid, half asleep,<br />
Waiting for his heart to break<br />
And the birds to join the flies<br />
Feasting at his bloodshot eyes,&mdash;<br />
<br />
Standing with his head hung down<br />
In a stupor, dreaming things:<br />
Green savannas, jungles brown,<br />
Battlefields and bellowings,<br />
Bulls undone and lions dead<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
And vultures flapping overhead.<br />
<br />
Dreaming things: of days he spent<br />
With his mother gaunt and lean<br />
In the valley warm and green,<br />
Full of baby wonderment,<br />
Blinking out of silly eyes<br />
At a hundred mysteries;<br />
<br />
Dreaming over once again<br />
How he wandered with a throng<br />
Of bulls and cows a thousand strong,<br />
Wandered on from plain to plain,<br />
Up the hill and down the dale,<br />
Always at his mother's tail;<br />
<br />
How he lagged behind the herd,<br />
Lagged and tottered, weak of limb,<br />
And she turned and ran to him<br />
Blaring at the loathly bird<br />
Stationed always in the skies,<br />
Waiting for the flesh that dies.<br />
<br />
Dreaming maybe of a day<br />
When her drained and drying paps<br />
Turned him to the sweets and saps,<br />
Richer fountains by the way,<br />
And she left the bull she bore<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
And he looked to her no more;<br />
<br />
And his little frame grew stout,<br />
And his little legs grew strong,<br />
And the way was not so long;<br />
And his little horns came out,<br />
And he played at butting trees<br />
And boulder-stones and tortoises,<br />
<br />
Joined a game of knobby skulls<br />
With the youngsters of his year,<br />
All the other little bulls,<br />
Learning both to bruise and bear,<br />
Learning how to stand a shock<br />
Like a little bull of rock.<br />
<br />
Dreaming of a day less dim,<br />
Dreaming of a time less far,<br />
When the faint but certain star<br />
Of destiny burned clear for him,<br />
And a fierce and wild unrest<br />
Broke the quiet of his breast.<br />
<br />
And the gristles of his youth<br />
Hardened in his comely pow,<br />
And he came to righting growth,<br />
Beat his bull and won his cow,<br />
And flew his tail and trampled off<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Past the tallest, vain enough,<br />
<br />
And curved about in splendour full<br />
And curved again and snuffed the airs<br />
As who should say Come out who dares I<br />
And all beheld a bull, a Bull,<br />
And knew that here was surely one<br />
That backed for no bull, fearing none.<br />
<br />
And the leader of the herd<br />
Looked and saw, and beat the ground,<br />
And shook the forest with his sound,<br />
Bellowed at the loathly bird<br />
Stationed always in the skies,<br />
Waiting for the flesh that dies.<br />
<br />
Dreaming, this old bull forlorn,<br />
Surely dreaming of the hour<br />
When he came to sultan power,<br />
And they owned him master-horn,<br />
Chiefest bull of all among<br />
Bulls and cows a thousand strong.<br />
<br />
And in all the tramping herd<br />
Not a bull that barred his way,<br />
Not a cow that said him nay,<br />
Not a bull or cow that erred<br />
In the furnace of his look<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Dared a second, worse rebuke;<br />
<br />
Not in all the forest wide,<br />
Jungle, thicket, pasture, fen,<br />
Not another dared him then,<br />
Dared him and again defied;<br />
Not a sovereign buck or boar<br />
Came a second time for more.<br />
<br />
Not a serpent that survived<br />
Once the terrors of his hoof<br />
Risked a second time reproof,<br />
Came a second time and lived,<br />
Not a serpent in its skin<br />
Came again for discipline;<br />
<br />
Not a leopard bright as flame,<br />
Flashing fingerhooks of steel,<br />
That a wooden tree might feel,<br />
Met his fury once and came<br />
For a second reprimand,<br />
Not a leopard in the land.<br />
<br />
Not a lion of them all<br />
Not a lion of the hills,<br />
Hero of a thousand kills,<br />
Dared a second fight and fall,<br />
Dared that ram terrific twice,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Paid a second time the price....<br />
<br />
Pity him, this dupe of dream,<br />
Leader of the herd again<br />
Only in his daft old brain,<br />
Once again the bull supreme<br />
And bull enough to bear the part<br />
Only in his tameless heart.<br />
<br />
Pity him that he must wake;<br />
Even now the swarm of flies<br />
Blackening his bloodshot eyes<br />
Bursts and blusters round the lake,<br />
Scattered from the feast half-fed,<br />
By great shadows overhead.<br />
<br />
And the dreamer turns away<br />
From his visionary herds<br />
And his splendid yesterday,<br />
Turns to meet the loathly birds<br />
Flocking round him from the skies,<br />
Waiting for the flesh that dies.<br />
<br />

THE SONG OF HONOUR<br />
<br />
<br />
I climbed a hill as light fell short,<br />
And rooks came home in scramble sort,<br />
And filled the trees and flapped and fought<br />
And sang themselves to sleep;<br />
An owl from nowhere with no sound<br />
Swung by and soon was nowhere found,<br />
I heard him calling half-way round,<br />
Holloing loud and deep;<br />
A pair of stars, faint pins of light,<br />
Then many a star, sailed into sight,<br />
And all the stars, the flower of night,<br />
Were round me at a leap;<br />
To tell how still the valleys lay<br />
I heard a watchdog miles away......<br />
And bells of distant sheep.<br />
<br />
I heard no more of bird or bell,<br />
The mastiff in a slumber fell,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
I stared into the sky,<br />
As wondering men have always done,<br />
Since beauty and the stars were one,<br />
Though none so hard as I.<br />
<br />
It seemed, so still the valleys were,<br />
As if the whole world knelt at prayer,<br />
Save me and me alone;<br />
So pure and wide that silence was<br />
I feared to bend a blade of grass,<br />
And there I stood like stone.<br />
<br />
There, sharp and sudden, there I heard&mdash;<br />
<i>Ah! some wild lovesick singing bird</i><br />
<i>Woke singing in the trees?</i><br />
<i>The nightingale and babble-wren</i><br />
<i>Were in the English greenwood then,</i><br />
<i>And you heard one of these?</i><br />
<br />
The babble-wren and nightingale<br />
Sang in the Abyssinian vale<br />
That season of the year!<br />
Yet, true enough, I heard them plain,<br />
I heard them both again, again,<br />
As sharp and sweet and clear<br />
As if the Abyssinian tree<br />
Had thrust a bough across the sea,<br />
Had thrust a bough across to me<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
With music for my ear!<br />
<br />
I heard them both, and oh! I heard<br />
The song of every singing bird<br />
That sings beneath the sky,<br />
And with the song of lark and wren<br />
The song of mountains, moths and men<br />
And seas and rainbows vie!<br />
<br />
I heard the universal choir<br />
The Sons of Light exalt their Sire<br />
With universal song,<br />
Earth's lowliest and loudest notes,<br />
Her million times ten million throats<br />
Exalt Him loud and long,<br />
And lips and lungs and tongues of Grace<br />
From every part and every place<br />
Within the shining of His face<br />
The universal throng.<br />
<br />
I heard the hymn of being sound<br />
From every well of honour found<br />
In human sense and soul:<br />
The song of poets when they write<br />
The testament of Beautysprite<br />
Upon a flying scroll,<br />
The song of painters when they take<br />
A burning brush for Beauty's sake<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
And limn her features whole&mdash;<br />
<br />
The song of men divinely wise<br />
Who look and see in starry skies<br />
Not stars so much as robins' eyes,<br />
And when these pale away<br />
Hear flocks of shiny pleiades<br />
Among the plums and apple trees<br />
Sing in the summer day&mdash;<br />
The song of all both high and low<br />
To some blest vision true,<br />
The song of beggars when they throw<br />
The crust of pity all men owe<br />
To hungry sparrows in the snow,<br />
Old beggars hungry too&mdash;<br />
The song of kings of kingdoms when<br />
They rise above their fortune men,<br />
And crown themselves anew,&mdash;<br />
<br />
The song of courage, heart and will<br />
And gladness in a fight,<br />
Of men who face a hopeless hill<br />
With sparking and delight,<br />
The bells and bells of song that ring<br />
Round banners of a cause or king<br />
From armies bleeding white&mdash;<br />
<br />
The songs of sailors every one<br />
When monstrous tide and tempest run<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
At ships like bulls at red,<br />
When stately ships are twirled and spun<br />
Like whipping-tops and help there's none<br />
And mighty ships ten thousand ton<br />
Go down like lumps of lead&mdash;<br />
<br />
And songs of fighters stern as they<br />
At odds with fortune night and day,<br />
Crammed up in cities grim and grey<br />
As thick as bees in hives,<br />
Hosannas of a lowly throng<br />
Who sing unconscious of their song,<br />
Whose lips are in their lives&mdash;<br />
<br />
And song of some at holy war<br />
With spells and ghouls more dread by far<br />
Than deadly seas and cities are,<br />
Or hordes of quarrelling kings&mdash;<br />
The song of fighters great and small,<br />
The song of pretty fighters all,<br />
And high heroic things&mdash;<br />
<br />
The song of lovers&mdash;who knows how<br />
Twitched up from place and time<br />
Upon a sigh, a blush, a vow,<br />
A curve or hue of cheek or brow,<br />
Borne up and off from here and now<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Into the void sublime!<br />
<br />
And crying loves and passions still<br />
In every key from soft to shrill<br />
And numbers never done,<br />
Dog-loyalties to faith and friend,<br />
And loves like Ruth's of old no end,<br />
And intermission none&mdash;<br />
<br />
And burst on burst for beauty and<br />
For numbers not behind,<br />
From men whose love of motherland<br />
Is like a dog's for one dear hand,<br />
Sole, selfless, boundless, blind&mdash;<br />
And song of some with hearts beside<br />
For men and sorrows far and wide,<br />
Who watch the world with pity and pride<br />
And warm to all mankind&mdash;<br />
<br />
And endless joyous music rise<br />
From children at their play,<br />
And endless soaring lullabies<br />
From happy, happy mother's eyes,<br />
And answering crows and baby cries,<br />
How many who shall say!<br />
And many a song as wondrous well<br />
With pangs and sweets intolerable<br />
From lonely hearths too gray to tell,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
God knows how utter gray!<br />
<br />
And song from many a house of care<br />
When pain has forced a footing there<br />
And there's a Darkness on the stair<br />
Will not be turned away&mdash;<br />
<br />
And song&mdash;that song whose singers come<br />
With old kind tales of pity from<br />
The Great Compassion's lips,<br />
That makes the bells of Heaven to peal<br />
Round pillows frosty with the feel<br />
Of Death's cold finger tips&mdash;<br />
<br />
The song of men all sorts and kinds,<br />
As many tempers, moods and minds<br />
As leaves are on a tree,<br />
As many faiths and castes and creeds,<br />
As many human bloods and breeds<br />
As in the world may be;<br />
<br />
The song of each and all who gaze<br />
On Beauty in her naked blaze,<br />
Or see her dimly in a haze,<br />
Or get her light in fitful rays<br />
And tiniest needles even,<br />
The song of all not wholly dark,<br />
Not wholly sunk in stupor stark<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Too deep for groping Heaven&mdash;<br />
<br />
And alleluias sweet and clear<br />
And wild with beauty men mishear,<br />
From choirs of song as near and dear<br />
To Paradise as they,<br />
The everlasting pipe and flute<br />
Of wind and sea and bird and brute,<br />
And lips deaf men imagine mute<br />
In wood and stone and clay;<br />
<br />
The music of a lion strong<br />
That shakes a hill a whole night long,<br />
A hill as loud as he,<br />
The twitter of a mouse among<br />
Melodious greenery,<br />
The ruby's and the rainbow's song,<br />
The nightingale's&mdash;all three,<br />
The song of life that wells and flows<br />
From every leopard, lark and rose<br />
And everything that gleams or goes<br />
Lack-lustre in the sea.<br />
<br />
I heard it all, each, every note<br />
Of every lung and tongue and throat,<br />
Ay, every rhythm and rhyme<br />
Of everything that lives and loves<br />
And upward, ever upward moves<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
From lowly to sublime!<br />
Earth's multitudinous Sons of Light,<br />
I heard them lift their lyric might<br />
With each and every chanting sprite<br />
That lit the sky that wondrous night<br />
As far as eye could climb!<br />
<br />
I heard it all, I heard the whole<br />
Harmonious hymn of being roll<br />
Up through the chapel of my soul<br />
And at the altar die,<br />
And in the awful quiet then<br />
Myself I heard Amen, Amen,<br />
Amen I heard me cry!<br />
I heard it all, and then although<br />
I caught my flying senses, oh,<br />
A dizzy man was I!<br />
I stood and stared; the sky was lit,<br />
The sky was stars all over it,<br />
I stood, I knew not why,<br />
Without a wish, without a will,<br />
I stood upon that silent hill<br />
And stared into the sky until<br />
My eyes were blind with stars and still<br />
I stared into the sky.<br />
<br />

STRINGS IN THE EARTH<br />

<br />
Strings in the earth and air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make music sweet;</span><br />
Strings by the river where<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The willows meet.</span><br />
<br />
There's music along the river<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Love wanders there,</span><br />
Pale flowers on his mantle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dark leaves on his hair.</span><br />
<br />
All softly playing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With head to the music bent,</span><br />

I HEAR AN ARMY<br />
<br />
<br />
I hear an army charging upon the land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees:</span><br />
Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Disdaining the reins, with fluttering whips, the charioteers.</span><br />
<br />
They cry unto the night their battle-name:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter.</span><br />
They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.</span><br />
<br />
They come shaking in triumph their long green hair:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore.</span><br />
My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone?</span><br />

SERVICE OF ALL THE DEAD<br />
<br />
<br />
Between the avenues of cypresses,<br />
All in their scarlet cloaks, and surplices<br />
Of linen, go the chaunting choristers,<br />
The priests in gold and black, the villagers.<br />
<br />
And all along the path to the cemetery<br />
The round, dark heads of men crowd silently,<br />
And black-scarved faces of women-folk, wistfully<br />
Watch at the banner of death, and the mystery.<br />
<br />
And at the foot of a grave a father stands<br />
With sunken head, and forgotten, folded hands;<br />
And at the foot of a grave a woman kneels<br />
With pale shut face, and neither hears nor feels<br />
<br />
The coming of the chaunting choristers<br />
Between the avenues of cypresses,<br />
The silence of the many villagers,<br />
The candle-flames beside the surplices.<br />

THOMAS MACDONAGH<br />
<br />
<br />
He shall not hear the bittern cry<br />
In the wild sky, where he is lain,<br />
Nor voices of the sweeter birds<br />
Above the wailing of the rain.<br />
<br />
Nor shall he know when loud March blows<br />
Thro' slanting snows her fanfare shrill,<br />
Blowing to flame the golden cup<br />
Of many an upset daffodil.<br />
<br />
But when the Dark Cow leaves the moor,<br />
And pastures poor with greedy weeds,<br />
Perhaps he'll hear her low at morn<br />
Lifting her horn in pleasant meads.<br />

IN SEPTEMBER<br />
<br />
<br />
Still are the meadowlands, and still<br />
Ripens the upland com,<br />
And over the brown gradual hill<br />
The moon has dipped a horn.<br />
<br />
The voices of the dear unknown<br />
With silent hearts now call,<br />
My rose of youth is overblown<br />
And trembles to the fall.<br />
<br />
My song forsakes me like the birds<br />
That leave the rain and grey,<br />
I hear the music of the words<br />
My lute can never say.<br />

TRINITY SUNDAY<br />
<br />
<br />
As I walked in Petty Cury on Trinity Day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the cuckoos in the fields did shout,</span><br />
Right through the city stole the breath of the may,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the scarlet doctors all about</span><br />
<br />
Lifted up their heads to snuff at the breeze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And forgot they were bound for great St. Mary's</span><br />
To listen to a sermon from the Master of Caius,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And "How balmy," they said, "the air is!"</span><br />
<br />
And balmy it was; and the sweet bells rocking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shook it till it rent in two</span><br />
And fell, a torn veil; and like maniacs mocking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wild things from without passed through.</span><br />
<br />
Wild wet things that swam in King's Parade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The days it was a marshy fen,</span><br />
Through the rent veil they did sprawl and wade<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blind bog-beasts and Ugrian men.</span><br />
<br />
And the city was not. (For cities are wrought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the stuff of the world's live brain.</span><br />
Cities are thin veils, woven of thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thought, breaking, rends them in twain.)</span><br />
<br />
And the fens were not. (For fens are dreams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dreamt by a race long dead;</span><br />
And the earth is naught, and the sun but seems:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so those who know have said.)</span><br />
<br />
So veil beyond veil inimitably lifted:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I saw the world's naked face,</span><br />
Before, reeling and baffled and blind, I drifted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Back within the bounds of space.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15%;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span><br />
<br />
I have forgot the unforgettable.<br />

INSCRIPTION ON A RUIN<br />
<br />
<br />
I stood beside the postern here,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">High up above the trampling sea,</span><br />
In shadow, shrinking from the spear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of light, not daring hence to flee.</span><br />
<br />
The moon beyond the western cliff<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had passed, and let the shadow fall,</span><br />
Across the water to the skiff<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That came on to the castle wall.</span><br />
<br />
I heard below murmur of words<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not loud, the splash upon the strand,</span><br />
And the long cry of darkling birds.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ivory horn fell from my hand.</span><br />

THE NIGHT HUNT<br />
<br />
<br />
In the morning, in the dark,<br />
When the stars begin to blunt,<br />
By the wall of Barn a Park<br />
Dogs I heard and saw them hunt;<br />
All the parish dogs were there,<br />
All the dogs for miles around,<br />
Teeming up behind a hare,<br />
In the dark, without a sound.<br />
<br />
How I heard I scarce can tell&mdash;<br />
'Twas a patter in the grass&mdash;<br />
And I did not see them well<br />
Come across the dark and pass;<br />
Yet I saw them and I knew<br />
Spearman's dog and Spellman's dog<br />
And, beside my own dog too,<br />
Leamy's from the Island Bog.<br />
<br />
In the morning when the sun<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Burnished all the green to gorse,<br />
I went out to take a run<br />
Round the bog upon my horse;<br />
And my dog that had been sleeping<br />
In the heat beside the door<br />
Left his yawning and went leaping<br />
On a hundred yards before.<br />
<br />
Through the village street we passed&mdash;<br />
Not a dog there raised a snout&mdash;<br />
Through the street and out at last<br />
On the white bog road and out<br />
Over Barna Park full pace,<br />
Over to the silver stream,<br />
Horse and dog in happy race,<br />
Rider between thought and dream.<br />
<br />
By the stream, at Leamy's house,<br />
Lay a dog&mdash;my pace I curbed&mdash;<br />
But our coming did not rouse<br />
Him from drowsing undisturbed;<br />
And my dog, as unaware<br />
Of the other, dropped beside<br />
And went running by me there<br />
With my horse's slackened stride.<br />
<br />
Yet by something, by a twitch<br />
Of the sleeper's eye, a look<br />
From the runner, something which<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Little chords of feeling shook,<br />
I was conscious that a thought<br />
Shuddered through the silent deep<br />
Of a secret&mdash;I had caught<br />
Something I had known in sleep.<br />

C. L. M.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the dark womb where I began<br />
My mother's life made me a man.<br />
Through all the months of human birth<br />
Her beauty fed my common earth.<br />
I cannot see, nor breathe, nor stir,<br />
But through the death of some of her.<br />
<br />
Down in the darkness of the grave<br />
She cannot see the life she gave.<br />
For all her love, she cannot tell<br />
Whether I use it ill or well,<br />
Nor knock at dusty doors to find<br />
Her beauty dusty in the mind.<br />
<br />
If the grave's gates could be undone,<br />
She would not know her little son,<br />
I am so grown. If we should meet<br />
She would pass by me in the street,<br />
Unless my soul's face let her see<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
My sense of what she did for me.<br />
<br />
What have I done to keep in mind<br />
My debt to her and womankind?<br />
What woman's happier life repays<br />
Her for those months of wretched days?<br />
For all my monthless body leeched<br />
Ere Birth's releasing hell was reached?<br />
<br />
What have I done, or tried, or said<br />
In thanks to that dear woman dead?<br />
Men triumph over women still,<br />
Men trample women's rights at will,<br />
And man's lust roves the world untamed.<br />

WHAT AM I, LIFE?<br />
<br />
<br />
What am I, Life? A thing of watery salt<br />
Held in cohesion by unresting cells<br />
Which work they know not why, which never halt,<br />
Myself unwitting where their master dwells.<br />
I do not bid them, yet they toil, they spin;<br />
A world which uses me as I use them,<br />
Nor do I know which end or which begin,<br />
Nor which to praise, which pamper, which condemn.<br />
So, like a marvel in a marvel set,<br />
I answer to the vast, as wave by wave<br />
The sea of air goes over, dry or wet,<br />
Or the full moon comes swimming from her cave,<br />
Or the great sun comes north, this myriad I<br />
Tingles, not knowing how, yet wondering why.<br />

JOURNEY<br />
<br />
<br />
I<br />
<br />
How many times I nearly miss the train<br />
By running up the staircase once again<br />
For some dear trifle almost left behind.<br />
At that last moment the unwary mind<br />
Forgets the solemn tick of station-time;<br />
That muddy lane the feet must climb&mdash;<br />
The bridge&mdash;the ticket&mdash;signal down&mdash;<br />
Train just emerging beyond the town:<br />
The great blue engine panting as it takes<br />
The final curve, and grinding on its brakes<br />
Up to the platform-edge... The little doors<br />
Swing open, while the burly porter roars.<br />
The tight compartment fills: our careful eyes<br />
Go to explore each other's destinies.<br />
A lull. The station-master waves. The train<br />
Gathers, and grips, and takes the rails again,<br />
Moves to the shining open land, and soon<br />
Begins to tittle-tattle a tame tattoon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
II<br />
<br />
They ramble through the country-side,<br />
Dear gentle monsters, and we ride<br />
Pleasantly seated&mdash;so we sink<br />
Into a torpor on the brink<br />
Of thought, or read our books, and understand<br />
Half them and half the backward-gliding land:<br />
(Trees in a dance all twirling round;<br />
Large rivers flowing with no sound;<br />
The scattered images of town and field,<br />
Shining flowers half concealed.)<br />
And, having settled to an equal rate,<br />
They swing the curve and straighten to the straight,<br />
Curtail their stride and gather up their joints,<br />
Snort, dwindle their steam for the noisy points,<br />
Leap them in safety, and, the other side,<br />
Loop again to an even stride.<br />
<br />
The long train moves: we move in it along.<br />
Like an old ballad, or an endless song,<br />
It drones and wimbles its unwearied croon&mdash;<br />
Croons, drones, and mumbles all the afternoon.<br />
<br />
Towns with their fifty chimneys close and high,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Wreathed in great smoke between the earth and sky,<br />
It hurtles through them, and you think it must<br />
Halt&mdash;but it shrieks and sputters them with dust,<br />
Cracks like a bullet through their big affairs,<br />
Rushes the station-bridge, and disappears<br />
Out to the suburb, laying bare<br />
Each garden trimmed with pitiful care;<br />
Children are caught at idle play,<br />
Held a moment, and thrown away.<br />
Nearly everyone looks round.<br />
Some dignified inhabitant is found<br />
Right in the middle of the commonplace&mdash;<br />
Buttoning his trousers, or washing his face.<br />
<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
Oh the wild engine! Every time I sit<br />
In any train I must remember it.<br />
The way it smashes through the air; its great<br />
Petulant majesty and terrible rate:<br />
Driving the ground before it, with those round<br />
Feet pounding, eating, covering the ground;<br />
The piston using up the white steam so<br />
You cannot watch it when it come or go;<br />
The cutting, the embankment; how it takes<br />
The tunnels, and the clatter that it makes;<br />
So careful of the train and of the track,<br />
Guiding us out, or helping us go back;<br />
Breasting its destination: at the close<br />
Yawning, and slowly dropping to a doze.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
IV<br />
<br />
We who have looked each other in the eyes<br />
This journey long, and trundled with the train,<br />
Now to our separate purposes must rise,<br />
Becoming decent strangers once again.<br />
The little chamber we have made our home<br />
In which we so conveniently abode,<br />
The complicated journey we have come,<br />
Must be an unremembered episode.<br />
Our common purpose made us all like friends.<br />
How suddenly it ends!<br />
A nod, a murmur, or a little smile,<br />
Or often nothing, and away we file.<br />
I hate to leave you, comrades. I will stay<br />
To watch you drift apart and pass away.<br />
It seems impossible to go and meet<br />
All those strange eyes of people in the street.<br />
But, like some proud unconscious god, the train<br />
Gathers us up and scatters us again.<br />
<br />

SOLITUDE<br />
<br />
<br />
When you have tidied all things for the night,<br />
And while your thoughts are fading to their sleep,<br />
You'll pause a moment in the late firelight,<br />
Too sorrowful to weep.<br />
<br />
The large and gentle furniture has stood<br />
In sympathetic silence all the day<br />
With that old kindness of domestic wood;<br />
Nevertheless the haunted room will say:<br />
"Some one must be away."<br />
<br />
The little dog rolls over half awake,<br />
Stretches his paws, yawns, looking up at you,<br />
Wags his tail very slightly for your sake,<br />
That you may feel he is unhappy too.<br />
<br />
A distant engine whistles, or the floor<br />
Creaks, or the wandering night-wind bangs a door.<br />
<br />
Silence is scattered like a broken glass.<br />
The minutes prick their ears and run about,<br />
Then one by one subside again and pass<br />
Sedately in, monotonously out.<br />
<br />
You bend your head and wipe away a tear.<br />
Solitude walks one heavy step more near.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

MILK FOR THE CAT<br />
<br />
<br />
When the tea is brought at five o'clock,<br />
And all the neat curtains are drawn with care,<br />
The little black cat with bright green eyes<br />
Is suddenly purring there.<br />
<br />
At first she pretends, having nothing to do,<br />
She has come in merely to blink by the grate,<br />
But, though tea may be late or the milk may be sour<br />
She is never late.<br />
<br />
And presently her agate eyes<br />
Take a soft large milky haze,<br />
And her independent casual glance<br />
Becomes a stiff, hard gaze.<br />
<br />
Then she stamps her claws or lifts her ears,<br />
Or twists her tail and begins to stir,<br />
Till suddenly all her lithe body becomes<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
One breathing, trembling purr.<br />
<br />
The children eat and wriggle and laugh;<br />
The two old ladies stroke their silk:<br />
But the cat is grown small and thin with desire,<br />
Transformed to a creeping lust for milk:<br />
<br />
The white saucer like some full moon descends<br />
At last from the clouds of the table above;<br />
She sighs and dreams and thrills and glows,<br />
Transfigured with love.<br />
<br />
She nestles over the shining rim,<br />
Buries her chin in the creamy sea;<br />
Her tail hangs loose; each drowsy paw<br />
Is doubled under each bending knee.<br />
<br />
A long dim ecstasy holds her life;<br />
Her world is an infinite shapeless white,<br />
Till her tongue has curled the last half drop,<br />
Then she sinks back into the night,<br />
<br />
Draws and dips her body to heap<br />
Her sleepy nerves in the great arm-chair,<br />
Lies defeated and buried deep<br />
Three or four hours unconscious there.<br />

SENT FROM EGYPT WITH A FAIR ROBE<br />
OF TISSUE TO A SICILIAN VINE-DRESSER.<br />
<br />
276 B.C.<br />
<br />
<br />
Put out to sea, if wine thou wouldest make<br />
Such as is made in Cos: when open boat<br />
May safely launch, advice of pilots take;<br />
And find the deepest bottom, most remote<br />
From all encroachment of the crumbling shore,<br />
Where no fresh stream tempers the rich salt wave,<br />
Forcing rash sweetness on sage ocean's brine;<br />
As youthful shepherds pour<br />
Their first love forth to Battos gnarled and grave,<br />
Fooling shrewd age to bless some fond design.<br />
<br />
Not after storm! but when, for a long spell,<br />
No white-maned horse has raced across the blue,<br />
Put from the beach! lest troubled be the well&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Less pure thy draught than from such depth were due.<br />
Fast close thy largest jars, prepared and clean!<br />
Next weigh each buoyant womb down through the flood,<br />
Far down! when, with a cord the lid remove,<br />
And it will fill unseen,<br />
Swift as a heart Love smites sucks back the blood:&mdash;<br />
This bubbles, deeper born than sighs, shall prove.<br />
<br />
If thy bowed shoulders ache, as thou dost haul&mdash;<br />
Those groan who climb with rich ore from the mine;<br />
Labour untold round Ilion girt a wall;<br />
A god toiled that Achilles' arms might shine;<br />
Think of these things and double knit thy will!<br />
Then, should the sun be hot on thy return,<br />
Cover thy jars with piles of bladder weed,<br />
Dripping, and fragrant still<br />
From sea-wolds where it grows like bracken-fern:<br />
A grapnel dragged will soon supply thy need.<br />
<br />
Home to a tun-convey thy precious freight!<br />
Wherein, for thirty days, it should abide,<br />
Closed, yet not quite closed from the air, and wait<br />
While, through dim stillness, slowly doth subside<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
Thick sediment. The humour of a day,<br />
Which has defeated youth and health and joy,<br />
Down, through a dreamless sleep, will settle thus,<br />
Till riseth maiden gay<br />
Set free from all glooms past&mdash;or else a boy<br />
Once more a school-friend worthy Troilus.<br />
<br />
Yet to such cool wood tank some dream might dip:<br />
Vision of Aphrodite sunk to sleep,<br />
Or of some sailor let down from a ship,<br />
Young, dead, and lovely, while across the deep,<br />
Through the calm night, his hoarse-voiced comrades chaunt&mdash;<br />
So far at sea, they cannot reach the land<br />
To lay him perfect in the warm brown earth.<br />
Pray that such dreams there haunt!<br />
While, through damp darkness, where thy tun doth stand,<br />
Cold salamanders sidle round its girth.<br />
<br />
Gently draw off the clear and tomb it yet<br />
For other twenty days in cedarn casks!<br />
Where through trance, surely, prophecy will set;<br />
As, dedicated to light temple-tasks,<br />
The young priest dreams the unknown mystery.<br />
Through Ariadne, knelt disconsolate<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
In the sea's marge, so welled back warmth which throbbed<br />
With nuptial promise: she<br />
Turned; and, half-choked through dewy glens, some great,<br />
Some magic drone of revel coming sobbed.<br />
<br />
Of glorious fruit, indeed, must be thy choice,<br />
Such as has fully ripened on the branch,<br />
Such as due rain, then sunshine, made rejoice,<br />
Which, pulped and coloured, now deep bloom doth blanch;<br />
Clusters like odes for victors in the games,<br />
Strophe on strophe globed, pure nectar all!<br />
Spread such to dry,&mdash;if Helios grant thee grace,<br />
Exposed unto his flames<br />
Two days, or, if not, three; or, should rain fall;<br />
Stretch them on hurdles in the house four days.<br />
<br />
Grapes are not sharded chestnuts, which the tree<br />
Lets fall to burst them on the ground, where red<br />
Rolls forth the fruit, from white-lined wards set free,<br />
And all undamaged glows 'mid husks it shed;<br />
Nay, they are soft and should be singly stripped<br />
From off the bunch, by maiden's dainty hand,<br />
Then dropped through the cool silent depth to sink<br />
(Coy, as herself hath slipped,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Bathing, from shelves in caves along the strand)<br />
<br />
Till round each dark grape water barely wink;<br />
Since some nine measures of sea-water fill<br />
A butt of fifty, ere the plump fruit peep,<br />
&mdash;Like sombre dolphin shoals when nights are still,<br />
Which penned in Proteus' wizard circle sleep,<br />
And 'twixt them glinting curves of silver glance<br />
If Zephyr, dimpling dark calm, counts them o'er.&mdash;<br />
Let soak thy fruit for two days thus, then tread!<br />
While bare-legged bumpkins dance,<br />
Bright from thy bursting press arched spouts shall pour,<br />
And gurgling torrents towards thy vats run red.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the maidens, each with wooden rake,<br />
Drag back the skins and laugh at aprons splashed;<br />
Or youths rest, boasting how their brown arms ache,<br />
So fast their shovels for so long have flashed,<br />
Baffling their comrades' legs with mounting heaps.<br />
Treble their labour! still the happier they,<br />
Who at this genial task wear out long hours,<br />
Till vast night round them creeps,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
When soon the torch-light dance whirls them away;<br />
For gods who love wine double all their powers.<br />
Iacchus is the always grateful god!<br />
His vineyards are more fair than gardens far;<br />
Hanging, like those of Babylon, they nod<br />
O'er each Ionian cliff and hill-side scar!<br />
While Cypris lends him saltness, depth, and peace;<br />
The brown earth yields him sap for richest green;<br />
And he has borrowed laughter from the sky;<br />
Wildness from winds; and bees<br />
Bring honey.&mdash;Then choose casks which thou hast seen<br />
Are leakless, very wholesome, and quite dry!<br />
<br />
That Coan wine the very finest is,<br />
I do assure thee, who have travelled much<br />
And learned to judge of diverse vintages.<br />
Faint not before the toil! this wine is such<br />
As tempteth princes launch long pirate barks;&mdash;From<br />
which may Zeus protect Sicilian bays,<br />
And, ere long, me safe home from Egypt bring,<br />
Letting no black-sailed sharks<br />
Scent this king's gifts, for whom I sweeten praise<br />
With those same songs thou didst to Chloe sing!<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
I wrote them 'neath the vine-cloaked elm, for thee.<br />
Recall those nights! our couches were a load<br />
Of scented lentisk; upward, tree by tree,<br />
Thy father's orchard sloped, and past us flowed<br />
A stream sluiced for his vineyards; when, above,<br />
The apples fell, they on to us were rolled,<br />
But kept us not awake.&mdash;O Laco, own<br />
How thou didst rave of love!<br />
Now art thou staid, thy son is three years old;<br />
But I, who made thee love-songs, live alone.<br />
<br />
Muse thou at dawn o'er thy yet slumbering wife!&mdash;<br />
Not chary of her best was nature there,<br />
Who, though a third of her full gift of life<br />
Was spent, still added beauties still more rare;<br />
What calm slow days, what holy sleep at night,<br />
Evolved her for long twilight trystings fraught<br />
With panic blushes and tip-toe surmise:<br />
And then, what mystic might&mdash;<br />
All, with a crowning boon, through travail brought!<br />
Consider this and give thy best likewise!<br />
<br />
Ungrateful be not! Laco, ne'er be that!<br />
Well worth thy while to make such wine 'twould be;<br />
I see thy red face 'neath thy broad straw hat,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
I see thy house, thy vineyards, Sicily!&mdash;<br />
Thou dost demur, good but too easy friend!<br />
Come, put those doubts away! thou hast strong lads,<br />
Brave wenches; on the steep beach lolls thy ship<br />
Where vine-clad slopes descend,<br />
Sheltering our bay, that headlong rillet glads,<br />
Like a stripped child fain in the sea to dip.<br />

A SPANISH PICTURE<br />
<br />
<br />
Thy life is over now, Don Juan:<br />
Thy fingers are so shrunk<br />
That all their rings from off their cold tips crowd,<br />
Where limp thy hand hath sunk;<br />
<br />
On a trestle-table laid, Don Juan,<br />
A half-mask near thine ear,<br />
A visor black in which void gape two gaps<br />
Where through thou oft didst leer.<br />
<br />
Thou waitest for the priests, Don Juan,<br />
To bear thee to thy grave;<br />
Thou'rt theirs at length beyond all doubt, but ha!<br />
Hast now no soul to save.<br />
<br />
Thou wast brought home last night, Don Juan,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Upon a stable door;<br />
Beneath a young nun's casement, found dropped dead,<br />
Where thou hadst wooed of yore:<br />
<br />
To pay their trouble then, Don Juan,<br />
Those base grooms took thy sword;<br />
A rapier to fetch gold, with shagreened sheath,<br />
Wrought hand-grip, and silk cord;<br />
<br />
Which, with thy fame enhanced, Don Juan,<br />
Were worth hidalgo's rent;<br />
Yet on which now, at most, some few moidore<br />
May by some fop be spent.<br />
<br />
Dull brown a cloak enwraps, Don Juan,<br />
Both thy lean shanks, one arm,<br />
That old bird-cage thy breast, where like magpie<br />
Thy heart hopped on alarm.<br />
<br />
Yet out beyond thy cloak, Don Juan,<br />
Thrust prim white-stocking'd feet&mdash;Silk-stocking'd<br />
feet that in quadrille pranced round&mdash;<br />
Slippers high-heeled and neat;<br />
<br />
Thy silver-buckled shoes, Don Juan,<br />

A half-peeled onion's core:<br />
<br />
Munching, a crone, that knew, Don Juan,<br />
Thy best contrived plots,<br />
Hobbles about the room, whose gaunt stone walls<br />
Drear echo as she trots;<br />
<br />
She makes her bundle up, Don Juan;<br />
She'll not forget thy rings,<br />
Thy buckles, nor silk stockings; nay, not she!<br />
They'll go with her few things.<br />
<br />
Those lids she hath pulled down, Don Juan,<br />
That lowered ne'er for shame;<br />
No spark from beauty more in thy brain pan,<br />
Shall make its tinder flame:<br />
<br />
Thou hast enjoyed all that, Don Juan,<br />
Which good resolves doth daunt,<br />
Which hypocrites doth tempt to stake vile souls,<br />
Which cowards crave and want;<br />
<br />
Thou wast an envied man, Don Juan,<br />
Long shalt be envied still;<br />
Thou hadst thy beauty as the proud pard hath,<br />
And instinct trained to skill.<br />

A DUET<br />
<br />
<br />
"Flowers nodding gaily, scent in air,<br />
"Flowers posied, flowers for the hair,<br />
"Sleepy flowers, flowers bold to stare&mdash;<br />
"Oh, pick me some!"<br />
<br />
"Shells with lip, or tooth, or bleeding gum,<br />
"Tell-tale shells, and shells that whisper 'Come,'<br />
"Shells that stammer, blush, and yet are dumb&mdash;"<br />
"Oh, let me hear!"<br />
<br />
"Eyes so black they draw one trembling near,<br />
"Brown eyes, caverns flooded with a tear,<br />
"Cloudless eyes, blue eyes so windy clear&mdash;"<br />
"Oh, look at me!"<br />
<br />
"Kisses sadly blown across the sea,<br />
"Darkling kisses, kisses fair and free,<br />
"Bob-a-cherry kisses 'neath a tree&mdash;"<br />
"Oh, give me one!"<br />
<br />
Thus sang a king and queen in Babylon.<br />

THE GAZELLES<br />
<br />
<br />
When the sheen on tall summer grass is pale,<br />
Across blue skies white clouds float on<br />
In shoals, or disperse and singly sail,<br />
Till, the sun being set, they all are gone:<br />
<br />
Yet, as long as they may shine bright in the sun,<br />
They flock or stray through the daylight bland,<br />
While their stealthy shadows like foxes run<br />
Beneath where the grass is dry and tanned:<br />
<br />
And the waste, in hills that swell and fall,<br />
Goes heaving into yet dreamier haze;<br />
And a wonder of silence is over all<br />
Where the eye feeds long like a lover's gaze:<br />
<br />
Then, cleaving the grass, gazelles appear<br />
(The gentler dolphins of kindlier waves)<br />
With sensitive heads alert of ear;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Frail crowds that a delicate hearing saves,<br />
<br />
That rely on the nostrils' keenest power,<br />
And are governed from trance-like distances<br />
By hopes and fears, and, hour by hour,<br />
Sagacious of safety, snuff the breeze.<br />
<br />
They keep together, the timid hearts;<br />
And each one's fear with a panic thrill<br />
Is passed to an hundred; and if one starts<br />
In three seconds all are over the hill.<br />
<br />
A Nimrod might watch, in his hall's wan space,<br />
After the feast, on the moonlit floor,<br />
The timorous mice that troop and race,<br />
As tranced o'er those herds the sun doth pour;<br />
<br />
Like a wearied tyrant sated with food<br />
Who envies each tiniest thief that steals<br />
Its hour from his abstracted mood,<br />
For it living zest and beauty reveals.<br />
<br />
He alone, save the quite dispassionate moon,<br />
Sees them; she stares at the prowling pard<br />
Who surprises their sleep and, ah! how soon<br />
Is riding the weakest or sleepiest hard!<br />
<br />
Let an agony's nightmare course begin,<br />
Four feet with five spurs a piece control,<br />
Like a horse thief reduced to save his skin<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Or a devil that rides a human soul!<br />
<br />
The race is as long as recorded time,<br />
Yet brief as the flash of assassin's knife;<br />
For 'tis crammed as history is with crime<br />
'Twixt the throbs at taking and losing life;<br />
<br />
Then the warm wet clutch on the nape of the neck,<br />
Through which the keen incisors drive;<br />
Then the fleet knees give, down drops the wreck<br />
Of yesterday's pet that was so alive.<br />
<br />
Yet the moon is naught concerned, ah no!<br />
She shines as on a drifting plank<br />
Far in some northern sea-stream's flow<br />
From which two numbed hands loosened and sank.<br />
<br />
Such thinning their number must suffer; and worse<br />
When hither at times the Shah's children roam,<br />
Their infant listlessness to immerse<br />
In energy's ancient upland home:<br />
<br />
For here the shepherd in years of old<br />
Was taught by the stars, and bred a race<br />
That welling forth from these highlands rolled<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
In tides of conquest o'er earth's face:<br />
<br />
On piebald ponies or else milk-white,<br />
Here, with green bridles in silver bound,<br />
A crescent moon on the violet night<br />
Of their saddle cloths, or a sun rayed round,&mdash;<br />
<br />
With tiny bells on their harness ringing,<br />
And voices that laugh and are shrill by starts,<br />
Prancing, curvetting, and with them bringing<br />
Swift chetahs cooped up in light-wheeled carts,<br />
<br />
They come, and their dainty pavilions pitch<br />
In some valley, beside a sinuous pool,<br />
Where a grove of cedars towers in which<br />
Herons have built, where the shade is cool;<br />
<br />
Where they tether their ponies to low hung boughs,<br />
Where long through the night their red fires gleam,<br />
Where the morning's stir doth them arouse<br />
To their bath in the lake, as from dreams to a dream.<br />
<br />
And thence in an hour their hunt rides forth,<br />
And the chetahs course the shy gazelle<br />
To the east or west or south or north,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
And every eve in a distant vale<br />
<br />
A hetacomb of the slaughtered beasts<br />
Is piled; tongues loll from breathless throats;<br />
Round large jet eyes the horsefly feasts&mdash;<br />
Jet eyes, which now a blue film coats:<br />
<br />
Dead there they bleed, and each prince there<br />
Is met by his sister, wife, or bride&mdash;<br />
Delicious ladies with long dark hair,<br />
And soft dark eyes, and brows arched wide,<br />
<br />
In quilted jacket, embroidered sash,<br />
And tent-like skirts of pleated lawn;<br />
While their silk-lined jewelled slippers flash<br />
Round bare feet bedded like pools at dawn:<br />
<br />
So choicefully prepared to please,<br />
Young, female, royal of race and mood,<br />
In indolent compassion these<br />
O'er those dead beauteous creatures brood:<br />
<br />
They lean some minutes against their friend,<br />
A lad not slow to praise himself,<br />
Who tells how this one met his end<br />
Out-raced, or trapped by leopard stealth,<br />
<br />
And boasts his chetahs fleetest are;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Through his advice the chance occurred,<br />
That leeward vale by which the car<br />
Was well brought round to head the herd.<br />
<br />
Seeing him bronzed by sun and wind,<br />
She feels his power and owns him lord,<br />
Then, that his courage may please her mind,<br />
With a soft coy hand half draws his sword,<br />
<br />
Just shudders to see the cold steel gleam,<br />
And drops it back in the long curved sheath;<br />
She will make his evening meal a dream<br />
And surround his sleep like some rich wreath<br />
<br />
Of heavy-lidded flowers bewitched<br />
To speak soft words of ecstasy<br />
To wizard king old, wise, and enriched<br />
With all save youth's and love's sweet glee.<br />
<br />
But, while they sleep, the orphaned herd<br />
And wounded stragglers, through the night<br />
Wander in pain, and wail unheard<br />
To the moon and the stars so cruelly bright:<br />
<br />
Why are they born? ah! why beget<br />
They in the long November gloom<br />
Heirs of their beauty, their fleetness,&mdash;yet<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
Heirs of their panics, their pangs, their doom?<br />
<br />
That to princely spouses children are born<br />
To be daintily bred and taught to please,<br />
Has a fitness like the return of morn:<br />
But why perpetuate lives like these?<br />
<br />
Why, with horns that jar and with fiery eyes,<br />
Should the male stags fight for the shuddering does<br />
Through the drear dark nights, with frequent cries<br />
From tyrant lust or outlawed woes?<br />
<br />
Doth the meaningless beauty of their lives<br />
Rave in the spring, when they course afar<br />
Like the shadows of birds, and the young fawn strives<br />
Till its parents no longer the fleetest are?<br />
<br />
Like the shadows of flames which the sun's rays throw<br />
On a kiln's blank wall, where glaziers dwell,<br />
Pale shadows as those from glasses they blow,<br />
Yet that lap at the blank wall and rebel,&mdash;<br />
<br />
Even so to my curious trance-like thought<br />
Those herds move over those pallid hills,<br />
With fever as of a frail life caught<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
In circumstance o'er-charged with ills;<br />
<br />
More like the shadow of lives than life,<br />
Or most like the life that is never born<br />
From baffled purpose and foredoomed strife,<br />
That in each man's heart must be hidden from scorn<br />
<br />
Yet with something of beauty very rare<br />
Unseizable, fugitive, half discerned;<br />
The trace of intentions that might have been fair<br />
In action, left on a face that yearned<br />
<br />
But long has ceased to yearn, alas!<br />
So faint a trace do they leave on the slopes<br />
Of hills as sleek as their coats with grass;<br />
So faint may the trace be of noblest hopes.<br />
<br />
Yet why are they born to roam and die?<br />
Can their beauty answer thy query, O soul?<br />
Nay, nor that of hopes which were born to fly,<br />
But whose pinions the common and coarse day stole.<br />
<br />
Like that region of grassy hills outspread,<br />
A realm of our thoughts knows days and nights<br />
And summers and winters, and has fed<br />
Ineffectual herds of vanished delights.<br />

TO &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
Asleep within the deadest hour of night<br />
And turning with the earth, I was aware<br />
How suddenly the eastern curve was bright,<br />
As when the sun arises from his lair.<br />
But not the sun arose: it was thy hair<br />
Shaken up heaven in tossing leagues of light.<br />
<br />
Since then I know that neither night nor day<br />
May I escape thee, O my heavenly hell!<br />
Awake, in dreams, thou springest to waylay<br />
And should I dare to die, I know full well<br />
Whose voice would mock me in the mourning bell,<br />
Whose face would greet me in hell's fiery way.<br />

FAREWELL TO PLACE OF COMFORT<br />
<br />
<br />
For the last time, maybe, upon the knoll<br />
I stand. The eve is golden, languid, sad....<br />
Day like a tragic actor plays his role<br />
To the last whispered word, and falls gold-clad.<br />
I, too, take leave of all I ever had.<br />
<br />
They shall not say I went with heavy heart:<br />
Heavy I am, but soon I shall be free;<br />
I love them all, but O I now depart<br />
A little sadly, strangely, fearfully,<br />
As one who goes to try a Mystery.<br />
<br />
The bell is sounding down in Dedham Vale:<br />
Be still, O bell! too often standing here<br />
When all the air was tremulous, fine, and pale,<br />
Thy golden note so calm, so still, so clear,<br />
Out of my stony heart has struck a tear.<br />
<br />
And now tears are not mine. I have release<br />
From all the former and the later pain;<br />
Like the mid-sea I rock in boundless peace,<br />
Soothed by the charity of the deep sea rain....<br />
Calm rain! Calm sea! Calm found, long sought in vain.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
O bronzen pines, evening of gold and blue,<br />
Steep mellow slope, brimmed twilit pool below,<br />
Hushed trees, still vale dissolving in the dew,<br />
Farewell! Farewell! There is no more to do.<br />
<br />
We have been happy. Happy now I go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

THE FULL HEART<br />
<br />
<br />
Alone on the shore in the pause of the night-time<br />
I stand and I hear the long wind blow light;<br />
I view the constellations quietly, quietly burning;<br />
I hear the wave fall in the hush of the night.<br />
<br />
Long after I am dead, ended this bitter journey,<br />
Many another whose heart holds no light<br />
Shall your solemn sweetness, hush, awe, and comfort,<br />
O my companions, Wind, Waters, Stars, and Night.<br />
<br />

THE TOWER<br />
<br />
<br />
It was deep night, and over Jerusalem's low roofs<br />
The moon floated, drifting through high vaporous woofs.<br />
The moonlight crept and glistened silent, solemn, sweet,<br />
Over dome and column, up empty, endless street;<br />
In the closed, scented gardens the rose loosed from the stem<br />
Her white showery petals; none regarded them;<br />
The starry thicket breathed odours to the sentinel palm;<br />
Silence possessed the city like a soul possessed by calm.<br />
<br />
Not a spark in the warren under the giant night,<br />
Save where in a turret's lantern beamed a grave, still light:<br />
There in the topmost chamber a gold-eyed lamp was lit&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Marvellous lamp in darkness, informing, redeeming it!<br />
For, set in that tiny chamber, Jesus, the blessed and doomed,<br />
Spoke to the lone apostles as light to men entombed;<br />
And spreading His hands in blessing, as one soon to be dead,<br />
He put soft enchantment into spare wine and bread.<br />
<br />
The hearts of the disciples were broken and full of tears,<br />
Because their Lord, the spearless, was hedged about with spears;<br />
And in His face the sickness of departure had spread a gloom<br />
At leaving His young friends friendless.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">They could not forget the tomb.</span><br />
He smiled subduedly, telling, in tones soft as voice of the dove,<br />
The endlessness of sorrow, the eternal solace of love;<br />
And lifting the earthly tokens, wine and sorrowful bread,<br />
He bade them sup and remember One who lived and was dead.<br />
And they could not restrain their weeping.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">But one rose up to depart,</span><br />
Having weakness and hate of weakness raging within his heart,<br />
And bowed to the robed assembly whose eyes gleamed wet in the light.<br />
Judas arose and departed; night went out to the night.<br />
<br />
Then Jesus lifted His voice like a fountain in an ocean of tears,<br />
And comforted His disciples and calmed and allayed their fears.<br />
But Judas wound down the turret, creeping from floor to floor,<br />
And would fly; but one leaning, weeping, barred him beside the door.<br />
And he knew her by her ruddy garment and two yet-watching men:<br />
Mary of Seven Evils, Mary Magdalen.<br />
And he was frighted at her. She sighed: 'I dreamed Him dead.<br />
We sell the body for silver ...'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Then Judas cried out and fled</span><br />
Forth into the night!... The moon had begun to set;<br />
A drear, deft wind went sifting, setting the dust afret,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Into the heart of the city Judas ran on and prayed<br />
To stern Jehovah lest his deed make him afraid.<br />
But in the tiny lantern, hanging as if on air,<br />
The disciples sat unspeaking. Amaze and peace were there.<br />
For <i>His</i> voice, more lovely than song of all earthly birds,<br />
In accents humble and happy spoke slow, consoling words.<br />
<br />
Thus Jesus discoursed, and was silent, sitting upright, and soon<br />
Past the casement behind Him slanted the sinking moon;<br />
And, rising for Olivet, all stared, between love and dread,<br />
Seeing the torrid moon a ruddy halo behind His head.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

FULFILMENT<br />
<br />
<br />
Was there love once? I have forgotten her.<br />
Was there grief once? grief yet is mine.<br />
Other loves I have, men rough, but men who stir<br />
More grief, more joy, than love of thee and thine.<br />
<br />
Faces cheerful, full of whimsical mirth,<br />
Lined by the wind, burned by the sun;<br />
Bodies enraptured by the abounding earth,<br />
As whose children we are brethren: one.<br />
<br />
And any moment may descend hot death<br />
To shatter limbs! pulp, tear, blast<br />
Beloved soldiers who love rough life and breath<br />
Not less for dying faithful to the last.<br />
<br />
O the fading eyes, the grimed face turned bony,<br />
Oped mouth gushing, fallen head,<br />
Lessening pressure of a hand shrunk, clammed, and stony!<br />
O sudden spasm, release of the dead!<br />
<br />
Was there love once? I have forgotten her.<br />
Was there grief once? grief yet is mine.<br />
O loved, living, dying, heroic soldier,<br />
All, all, my joy, my grief, my love, are thine!<br />

THE SPRIG OF LIME<br />
<br />
<br />
He lay, and those who watched him were amazed<br />
To see unheralded beneath the lids<br />
Twin tears, new gathered at the price of pain,<br />
Start and at once run crookedly athwart<br />
Cheeks channelled long by pain, never by tears.<br />
So desolate too the sigh next uttered<br />
They had wept also, but his great lips moved,<br />
And bending down one heard, '<i>A sprig of lime;<br />
Bring me a sprig of lime.</i>' Whereat she stole<br />
With dumb signs forth to pluck the thing he craved.<br />
<br />
So lay he till a lime-twig had been snapped<br />
From some still branch that swept the outer grass<br />
Far from the silver pillar of the hole<br />
Which mounting past the house's crusted roof<br />
Split into massy limbs, crossed boughs, a maze<br />
Of close-compacted intercontorted staffs<br />
Bowered in foliage wherethrough the sun<br />
Shot sudden showers of light or crystal spars<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Or wavered in a green and vitreous flood.<br />
<br />
And all the while in faint and fainter tones<br />
Scarce audible on deepened evening's hush<br />
He framed his curious and last request,<br />
For '<i>lime, a sprig of lime.</i>' Her trembling hand<br />
Closed his loose fingers on the awkward stem<br />
Covered above with gentle heart-shaped leaves<br />
And under dangling, pale as honey-wax,<br />
Square clusters of sweet-scented starry flowers.<br />
<br />
She laid his bent arm back upon his breast,<br />
Then watched above white knuckles clenched in prayer.<br />
He never moved. Only at last his eyes<br />
Opened, then brightened in such avid gaze<br />
She feared the coma mastered him again ...<br />
But no; strange sobs rose chuckling in his throat,<br />
A stranger ecstasy suffused the flesh<br />
Of that just mask so sun-dried, gouged and old<br />
Which few&mdash;too few!&mdash;had loved, too many feared.<br />
'Father,' she cried; 'Father!'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">He did not hear.</span><br />
<br />
She knelt and kneeling drank the scent of limes,<br />
Blown round the slow blind by a vesperal gust,<br />
Till the room swam. So the lime incense blew<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Into her life as once it had in his,<br />
Though how and when and with what ageless charge<br />
Of sorrow and deep joy how could she know?<br />
<br />
Sweet lime that often at the height of noon<br />
Diffusing dizzy fragrance from your boughs,<br />
Tasselled with blossoms mere innumerable<br />
Than the black bees, the uproar of whose toil<br />
Filled your green vaults, winning such metheglyn<br />
As clouds their sappy cells, distil, as once<br />
Ye used, your sunniest emanations<br />
Toward the window where a woman kneels&mdash;She<br />
who within that room in childish hours<br />
Lay through the lasting murmur of blanch'd noon<br />
Behind the sultry blind, now full now flat,<br />
Drinking anew of every odorous breath,<br />
Supremely happy in her ignorance<br />
Of Time that hastens hourly and of Death<br />
Who need not haste. Scatter your fumes, O lime,<br />
Loose from each hispid star of citron bloom,<br />
Tangled beneath the labyrinthine boughs,<br />
Cloud on such stinging cloud of exhalations<br />
As reek of youth, fierce life and summer's prime,<br />
Though hardly now shall he in that dusk room<br />
Savour your sweetness, since the very sprig,<br />
Profuse of blossom and of essences,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
He smells not, who in a paltering hand<br />
Clasps it laid close his peaked and gleaming face<br />
Propped in the pillow. Breathe silent, lofty lime,<br />
Your curfew secrets out in fervid scent<br />
To the attendant shadows! Tinge the air<br />
Of the midsummer night that now begins,<br />
At an owl's oaring flight from dusk to dusk<br />
And downward caper of the giddy bat<br />
Hawking against the lustre of bare skies,<br />
With something of th' unfathomable bliss<br />
He, who lies dying there, knew once of old<br />
In the serene trance of a summer night<br />
When with th' abundance of his young bride's hair<br />
Loosed on his breast he lay and dared not sleep,<br />
Listening for the scarce motion of your boughs,<br />
Which sighed with bliss as she with blissful sleep,<br />
And drinking desperately each honied wave<br />
Of perfume wafted past the ghostly blind<br />
Knew first th' implacable and bitter sense<br />
Of Time that hastes and Death who need not haste.<br />
Shed your last sweetness, limes!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">But now no more.</span><br />
She, fruit of that night's love, she heeds you not,<br />
Who bent, compassionate, to the dim floor<br />
Takes up the sprig of lime and presses it<br />
In pain against the stumbling of her heart,<br />
Knowing, untold, he cannot need it now.<br />

THE TWILIGHT PEOPLE<br />

<br />
It is a whisper among the hazel bushes;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is a long low whispering voice that fills</span><br />
With a sad music the bending and swaying rushes;<br />

<br />
Twilight people, why will you still be crying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crying and calling to me out of the trees?</span><br />
For under the quiet grass the wise are lying,<br />

STRANGE MEETING<br />
<br />
<br />
It seemed that out of the battle I escaped<br />
Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped<br />
Through granites which Titanic wars had groined.<br />
Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,<br />
Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.<br />
Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared<br />
With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,<br />
Lifting distressful hands as if to bless.<br />
And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall.<br />
With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained;<br />
Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground,<br />
And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.<br />
"Strange, friend," I said, "here is no cause to mourn."<br />
"None," said the other, "save the undone years."<br />
The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,<br />
Was my life also; I went hunting wild<br />
After the wildest beauty in the world,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair,<br />
But mocks the steady running of the hour,<br />
And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here.<br />
For by my glee might many men have laughed,<br />
And of my weeping something has been left,<br />
Which must die now. I mean the truth untold,<br />
The pity of war, the pity war distilled.<br />
Now men will go content with what we spoiled,<br />
Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled.<br />
They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress,<br />
None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress.<br />
Courage was mine, and I had mystery,<br />
Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery;<br />
To miss the march of this retreating world<br />
Into vain citadels that are not walled.<br />
Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels<br />
I would go up and wash them from sweet wells,<br />
Even with truths that lie too deep for taint.<br />
I would have poured my spirit without stint<br />
But not through wounds; not on the cess of war.<br />
Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were.<br />
I am the enemy you killed, my friend.<br />
I knew you in this death: for so you frowned<br />
Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.<br />
I parried; but my hands were loath and cold.<br />
Let us sleep now......<br />

I SEE HIS BLOOD UPON THE ROSE<br />
<br />
<br />
I see His blood upon the rose<br />
And in the stars the glory of His eyes,<br />
His body gleams amid eternal snows,<br />
His tears fall from the skies.<br />
<br />
I see His face in every flower;<br />
The thunder and the singing of the birds<br />
Are but His voice&mdash;and carven by His power<br />
Rocks are His written words.<br />
<br />
All pathways by His feet are worn,<br />
His strong heart stirs the ever-beating sea,<br />
His crown of thorns is twined with every thorn,<br />
His cross is every tree.<br />

'IN THE PINK'<br />
<br />
<br />
So Davies wrote: 'This leaves me in the pink.<br />
Then scrawled his name: 'Your loving sweet-heart, Willie'<br />
With crosses for a hug. He'd had a drink<br />
Of rum and tea; and, though the barn was chilly,<br />
For once his blood ran warm; he had pay to spend.<br />
Winter was passing; soon the year would mend.<br />
<br />
He couldn't sleep that night. Stiff in the dark<br />
He groaned and thought of Sundays at the farm,<br />
When he'd go out as cheerful as a lark<br />
In his best suit to wander arm-in-arm<br />
With brown-eyed Gwen, and whisper in her ear<br />
The simple silly things she liked to hear.<br />
<br />
And then he thought: to-morrow night we trudge<br />
Up to the trenches, and my boots are rotten.<br />
Five miles of stodgy clay and freezing sludge,<br />
And everything but wretchedness forgotten.<br />
To-night he's in the pink; but soon he'll die.<br />
And still the war goes on; <i>he</i> don't know why.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
THE DEATH-BED<br />
<br />
<br />
He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped<br />
Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;<br />
Aqueous-like floating rays of amber light,<br />
Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep,&mdash;<br />
Silence and safety; and his mortal shore<br />
Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death.<br />
<br />
Some one was holding water to his mouth,<br />
He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped<br />
Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot<br />
The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.<br />
Water&mdash;calm, sliding green above the weir;<br />
Water&mdash;a sky-lit alley for his boat,<br />
Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers<br />
And shaken hues of summer: drifting down,<br />
He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept.<br />
<br />
Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,<br />
Blowing the curtain to a glimmering curve.<br />
Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars<br />
Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;<br />
Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.<br />
<br />
Rain; he could hear it rustling through the dark<br />
Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;<br />
Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers<br />
That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps<br />
Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace<br />
Gently and slowly washing life away.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">.&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; .</span><br />
He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain<br />
Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore<br />
His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.<br />
But some one was beside him; soon he lay<br />
Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.<br />
And Death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared.<br />
<br />
Light many lamps and gather round his bed.<br />
Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live.<br />
Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.<br />
He's young; he hated war; how should he die<br />
When cruel old campaigners win safe through?<br />
<br />
But Death replied: 'I choose him.' So he went,<br />
And there was silence in the summer night;<br />
Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.<br />
Then, far away, the thudding of the guns.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
COUNTER-ATTACK<br />
<br />
<br />
We'd gained our first objective hours before<br />
While dawn broke like a face with blinking eyes,<br />
Pallid, unshaved and thirsty, blind with smoke.<br />
Things seemed all right at first. We held their line,<br />
With bombers posted, Lewis guns well placed,<br />
And clink of shovels deepening the shallow trench.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The place was rotten with dead; green clumsy legs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">High-booted, sprawled and grovelled along the saps;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And trunks, face downward, in the sucking mud,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Wallowed like trodden sand-bags loosely filled;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And naked sodden buttocks, mats of hair,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bulged, clotted heads slept in the plastering slime.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And then the rain began,&mdash;the jolly old rain!</span><br />
A yawning soldier knelt against the bank,<br />
Staring across the morning blear with fog;<br />
He wondered when the Allemands would get busy;<br />
And then, of course, they started with five-nines<br />
Traversing, sure as fate, and never a dud.<br />
Mute in the clamour of shells he watched them burst,<br />
Spouting dark earth and wire with gusts from hell,<br />
While posturing giants dissolved in drifts of smoke.<br />
He crouched and flinched, dizzy with galloping fear,<br />
Sick for escape,&mdash;loathing the strangled horror<br />
And butchered, frantic gestures of the dead.<br />
<br />
An officer came blundering down the trench:<br />
"Stand-to and man the fire-step!"  On he went ...<br />
Gasping and bawling, "Fire-step... Counter-attack!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then the haze lifted. Bombing on the right</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Down the old sap: machine-guns on the left;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And stumbling figures looming out in front.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"O Christ, they're coming at us!" Bullets spat,</span><br />
And he remembered his rifle ... rapid fire ...<br />
And started blazing wildly ... Then a bang<br />
Crumpled and spun him sideways, knocked him out<br />
To grunt and wriggle: none heeded him; he choked<br />
And fought the flapping veils of smothering gloom,<br />
Lost in a blurred confusion of yells and groans ...<br />
Down, and down, and down, he sank and drowned,<br />
Bleeding to death. The counter-attack had failed.<br />
<br />

DREAMERS<br />
<br />
<br />
Soldiers are citizens of death's grey land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drawing no dividend from time's to-morrows.</span><br />
In the great hour of destiny they stand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each with his feuds, and jealousies, and sorrows.</span><br />
Soldiers are sworn to action; they must win<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some flaming, fatal climax with their lives.</span><br />
Soldiers are dreamers; when the guns begin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They think of firelit homes, clean beds, and wives.</span><br />
<br />
I see them in foul dug-outs, gnawed by rats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the ruined trenches, lashed with rain,</span><br />
Dreaming of things they did with balls and bats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mocked by hopeless longing to regain</span><br />
Bank-holidays, and picture shows, and spats,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And going to the office in the train.</span><br />

EVERYONE SANG<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone suddenly burst out singing;<br />
And I was filled with such delight<br />
As prisoned birds must find in freedom,<br />
Winging wildly across the white<br />
Orchards and dark-green fields; on&mdash;on&mdash;and out of sight.<br />
<br />
Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted;<br />
And beauty came like the setting sun:<br />
My heart was shaken with tears; and horror<br />
Drifted away ... O, but Everyone<br />
Was a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done.<br />

A NIGHT-PIECE<br />
<br />
<br />
Come out and walk. The last few drops of light<br />
Drain silently out of the cloudy blue;<br />
The trees are full of the dark-stooping night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The fields are wet with dew.</span><br />
<br />
All's quiet in the wood but, far away,<br />
Down the hillside and out across the plain,<br />
Moves, with long trail of white that marks its way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The softly panting train.</span><br />
<br />
Come through the clearing. Hardly now we see<br />
The flowers, save dark or light against the grass,<br />
Or glimmering silver on a scented tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That trembles as we pass.</span><br />
<br />
Hark now! So far, so far ... that distant song ...<br />
Move not the rustling grasses with your feet.<br />
The dusk is full of sounds, that all along<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The muttering boughs repeat.</span><br />
<br />
So far, so faint, we lift our heads in doubt.<br />
Wind, or the blood that beats within our ears,<br />
Has feigned a dubious and delusive note,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Such as a dreamer hears.</span><br />
<br />
Again ... again! The faint sounds rise and fail.<br />
So far the enchanted tree, the song so low ...<br />
A drowsy thrush? A waking nightingale?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Silence. We do not know.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
THE GLOW-WORM<br />
<br />
<br />
The pale road winds faintly upward into the dark skies,<br />
And beside it on the rough grass that the wind invisibly stirs,<br />
Sheltered by sharp-speared gorse and the berried junipers,<br />
Shining steadily with a green light, the glow-worm lies.<br />
<br />
We regard it; and this hill and all the other hills<br />
That fall in folds to the river, very smooth and steep,<br />
And the hangers and brakes that the darkness thickly fills<br />
Fade like phantoms round the light and night is deep, so deep,&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
That all the world is emptiness about the still flame<br />
And we are small shadows standing lost in the huge night.<br />
We gather up the glow-worm, stooping with dazzled sight,<br />
And carry it to the little enclosed garden whence we came,<br />
<br />
And place it on the short grass. Then the shadowy flowers fade,<br />
The walls waver and melt and the houses dis-appear<br />
And the solid town trembles into insubstantial shade<br />
Round the light of the burning glow-worm, steady and clear.<br />
<br />

THE HALT<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>"Mark time in front! Rear fours cover! Company&mdash;halt!</i><br />
<i>Order arms! Stand at&mdash;ease! Stand easy."</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sudden hush:</span><br />
And then the talk began with a mighty rush&mdash;<br />
"You weren't ever in step&mdash;The sergeant.&mdash;It wasn't my fault&mdash;<br />
Well, the Lord be praised at least for a ten minutes' halt."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We sat on a gate and watched them easing and shifting;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of the distance a faint, keen breath came drifting,</span><br />
From the sea behind the hills, and the hedges were salt.<br />
<br />
Where do you halt now? Under what hedge do you lie?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the tall poplars are fringing the white French roads?</span><br />
And smoke I have not seen discolours the foreign sky?<br />
Is the company resting there as we rested together<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stamping its feet and readjusting its loads</span><br />
And looking with wary eyes at the drooping weather?<br />

A HOLLOW ELM<br />
<br />
<br />
What hast thou not withstood;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Tempest-despising tree,</span><br />
Whose bleak and riven wood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Gapes now so hollowly,</span><br />
What rains have beaten thee through many years,<br />
What snows from off thy branches dripped like tears?<br />
<br />
Calmly thou standest now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon thy sunny mound;</span><br />
The first spring breezes flow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Past with sweet dizzy sound;</span><br />
Yet on thy pollard top the branches few<br />
Stand stiffly out, disdain to murmur too.<br />
<br />
The children at thy foot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Open new-lighted eyes,</span><br />
Where, on gnarled bark and root,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The soft, warm sunshine lies&mdash;</span><br />
Dost thou, upon thine ancient sides, resent<br />
The touch of youth, quick and impermanent?<br />
<br />
These, at the beck of spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Live in the moment still;</span><br />
Thy boughs unquivering,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Remembering winter's chill,</span><br />
And many other winters past and gone,<br />
Are mocked, not cheated, by the transient sun.<br />
<br />
Hast thou so much withstood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Tempest-despising tree,</span><br />
That now thy hollow wood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Stiffens disdainfully</span><br />
Against the soft spring airs and soft spring rain,<br />
Knowing too well that winter comes again?<br />

THE RETURN<br />
<br />
<br />
I<br />
<br />
Now into hearts long empty of the sun<br />
The morning comes again with golden light<br />
And all the shades of the half-dusk are done<br />
And all the crevices are suddenly bright.<br />
So gradually had love lain down to sleep,<br />
We knew it not; but when we saw his head<br />
Pillowed and sunken in a trance so deep<br />
We whispered shuddering that he was dead.<br />
Then you like Psyche took the light and leant<br />
Over the monster lying in his place,<br />
Daring, despairing, trembling as you bent ...<br />
But love raised up his new-awakening face<br />
And into our hearts long empty of the sun<br />
We felt the sky-distilled bright liquor run.<br />
<br />
<br />
II<br />
<br />
When love comes back that went in mist and cloud<br />
He comes triumphant in his pomp and power;<br />
Voices that muttered long are glad and loud<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
To mark the sweetness of the sudden hour.<br />
How could we live so long in that half-light?<br />
That opiate shadow, where the deadened nerves<br />
So soon forget how hills and winds are bright,<br />
That drugged and sleepy dusk, that only serves<br />
With false shades to conceal the emptiness<br />
Of hearts whence love has stolen unawares,<br />
Where creeping doubts and dumb, dull sorrows press<br />
And weariness with blind eyes gapes and stares.<br />
This was our state, but now a happy song<br />
Rings through our inner sunlight all day long.<br />
<br />
<br />
III<br />
<br />
When that I lay in a mute agony,<br />
I nothing saw nor heard nor felt nor thought,<br />
The inner self, the quintessential me,<br />
In that blind hour beyond all sense was brought<br />
Hard against pain. I had no body, no mind,<br />
Nought but the point that suffers joy or loss,<br />
No eyes in sudden blackness to be blind,<br />
No brain for swift regrets to run across.<br />
But when you touched me, when your hot tears fell,<br />
The point that had been nothing else but pain<br />
Changed into rapture by a miracle,<br />
In which all raptures known before were vain.<br />
Thus loss which bared the utmost shivering nerve<br />
For joy's precursor in the heart did serve.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

CLOUDS<br />
<br />
<br />
Over this hill the high clouds float all day<br />
And trail their long, soft shadows on the grass,<br />
And now above the meadows make delay<br />
And now with regular, swift motion pass.<br />
Now comes a threatening drift from the south-west,<br />
In smoky colours drest,<br />
That spills far out upon the chequered plain<br />
Its burden of dark rain;<br />
Then hard behind a stately galleon<br />
Sails onward with its piled and carven towers<br />
Stiff sculptured like a heap of marble flowers,<br />
Rigid, unaltering, a miracle<br />
Of moulded surfaces, whereon the light<br />
Shines steadily, intolerably bright;<br />
Now on a livelier wind a wandering bell<br />
Of delicate vapour comes, invisibly hung,<br />
Like feathers from the seeding thistle flung,<br />
And saunters wantonly far out of sight.<br />
O God, who fill'st with shifting imagery<br />
The blue page of the sky,<br />
Thus writ'st thou also, with as vague a pen,<br />
In the immenser hearts of dreaming men.<br />

THE ROCK POOL<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the Sea. In these uneven walls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A wave lies prisoned. Far and far away,</span><br />
Outward to ocean, as the slow tide falls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Her sisters, through the capes that hold the bay,</span><br />
Dancing in lovely liberty recede.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But lovely in captivity she lies,</span><br />
Filled with soft colours, where the waving weed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Moves gently, and discloses to our eyes</span><br />
Blurred shining veins of rock and lucent shells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Under the light-shot water, and here repose</span><br />
Small quiet fish, and dimly-glowing bells<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of sleeping sea-anemones that close</span><br />
Their tender fronds and will not now awake<br />
Till on these rocks the waves returning break.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
THE SWIMMERS<br />
<br />
<br />
The cove's a shining plate of blue and green,<br />
With darker belts between<br />
The trough and crest of the slow-rising swell,<br />
And the great rocks throw purple shadows down,<br />
Where transient sun-sparks wink and burst and drown<br />
And glimmering pebbles lie too deep to tell,<br />
Hidden or shining as the shadow wavers.<br />
And everywhere the restless sun-steeped air<br />
Trembles and quavers,<br />
As though it were<br />
More saturate with light than it could bear.<br />
<br />
Now come the swimmers from slow-dripping caves,<br />
Where the shy fern creeps under the veined roof,<br />
And wading out meet with glad breast the waves.<br />
One holds aloof,<br />
Climbing alone the reef with shrinking feet,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
That scarce endure the jagged stones' dull beat<br />
Till on the edge he poises<br />
And flies to cleave the water, vanishing<br />
In wreaths of white, with echoing liquid noises,<br />
And swims beneath, a vague, distorted thing.<br />
Now all the other swimmers leave behind<br />
The crystal shallow and the foam-wet shore<br />
And sliding into deeper water find<br />
A living coolness in the lifting flood,<br />
And through their bodies leaps the sparkling blood,<br />
So that they feel the faint earth's drought no more.<br />
There now they float, heads raised above the green,<br />
White bodies cloudily seen,<br />
Farther and farther from the brazen rock,<br />
On which the hot air shakes, on which the tide<br />
Fruitlessly throws with gentle, soundless shock<br />
The cool and lagging wave. Out, out they go,<br />
And now upon a mirrored cloud they ride<br />
Or turning over, with soft strokes and slow,<br />
Slide on like shadows in a tranquil sky.<br />
Behind them, on the tall, parched cliff, the dry<br />
And dusty grasses grow<br />
In shallow ledges of the arid stone,<br />
Starving for coolness and the touch of rain.<br />
But, though to earth they must return again,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
Here come the soft sea-airs to meet them, blown<br />
Over the surface of the outer deep,<br />
Scarce moving, staying, falling, straying, gone,<br />
Light and delightful as the touch of sleep...<br />
One wakes and splashes round,<br />
And, as by magic, all the others wake<br />
From that sea-dream, and now with rippling sound<br />
Their rapid arms the enchanted silence break.<br />
And now again the crystal shallows take<br />
The gleaming bedies whose cool hour is done;<br />
They pause upon the beach, they pause and sigh<br />
Then vanish in the caverns one by one.<br />
<br />
Soon the wet foot-marks on the stones are dry:<br />
The cove sleeps on beneath the unwavering sun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

THE STORM<br />
<br />
<br />
We wake to hear the storm come down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sudden on roof and pane;</span><br />
The thunder's loud and the hasty wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hurries the beating rain.</span><br />
<br />
The rain slackens, the wind blows gently,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gust grows gentle and stills,</span><br />
And the thunder, like a breaking stick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stumbles about the hills.</span><br />
<br />
The drops still hang on leaf and thorn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The downs stand up more green;</span><br />
The sun comes out again in power<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sky is washed and clean.</span><br />

GERMAN RAIN<br />
<br />
<br />
The heat came down and sapped away my powers.<br />
The laden heat came down and drowned my brain,<br />
Till through the weight of overcoming hours<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">felt the rain.</span><br />
<br />
Then suddenly I saw what more to see<br />
I never thought: old things renewed, retrieved,<br />
The rain that fell in England fell on me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">And I believed.</span><br />

ALL THE HILLS AND VALES<br />
<br />
<br />
All the hills and vales along<br />
Earth is bursting into song,<br />
And the singers are the chaps<br />
Who are going to die perhaps.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">O sing, marching men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Till the valleys ring again.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Give your gladness to earth's keeping,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So be glad, when you are sleeping.</span><br />
<br />
Cast away regret and rue,<br />
Think what you are marching to.<br />
Little live, great pass.<br />
Jesus Christ and Barabbas<br />
Were found the same day.<br />
This died, that went his way.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So sing with joyful breath.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For why, you are going to death.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Teeming earth will surely store</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">All the gladness that you pour.</span><br />
<br />
Earth that never doubts nor fears,<br />
Earth that knows of death, not tears,<br />
Earth that bore with joyful ease<br />
Hemlock for Socrates,<br />
Earth that blossomed and was glad<br />
'Neath the cross that Christ had,<br />
Shall rejoice and blossom too<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">When the bullet reaches you.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wherefore, men marching</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">On the road to death, sing!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Pour your gladness on earth's head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So be merry, so be dead.</span><br />
<br />
From the hills and valleys earth<br />
Shouts back the sound of mirth,<br />
Tramp of feet and lilt of song<br />
Ringing all the road along.<br />
All the music of their going,<br />
Ringing swinging glad song-throwing,<br />
Earth will echo still, when foot<br />
Lies numb and voice mute.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">On, marching men, on</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To the gates of death with song.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sow your gladness for earth's reaping,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So you may be glad, though sleeping.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Strew your gladness on earth's bed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So be merry, so be dead.</span><br />

DEIRDRE<br />
<br />
<br />
Do not let any woman read this verse;<br />
It is for men, and after them their sons<br />
And their sons' sons.<br />
<br />
The time comes when our hearts sink utterly;<br />
When we remember Deirdre and her tale,<br />
And that her lips are dust.<br />
<br />
Once she did tread the earth: men took her hand;<br />
They looked into her eyes and said their say,<br />
And she replied to them.<br />
<br />
More than a thousand years it is since she<br />
Was beautiful: she trod the waving grass;<br />
She saw the clouds.<br />
<br />
A thousand years! The grass is still the same,<br />
The clouds as lovely as they were that time<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
When Deirdre was alive.<br />
<br />
But there has never been a woman born<br />
Who was so beautiful, not one so beautiful<br />
Of all the women born.<br />
<br />
Let all men go apart and mourn together;<br />
No man can ever love her; not a man<br />
Can ever be her lover.<br />
<br />
No man can bend before her: no man say&mdash;<br />
What could one say to her? There are no words<br />
That one could say to her!<br />
<br />
Now she is but a story that is told<br />
Beside the fire! No man can ever be<br />
The friend of that poor queen.<br />

THE GOAT PATHS<br />
<br />
<br />
The crooked paths go every way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon the hill&mdash;they wind about</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through the heather in and out</span><br />
Of the quiet sunniness.<br />
And there the goats, day after day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stray in sunny quietness,</span><br />
Cropping here and cropping there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As they pause and turn and pass,</span><br />
Now a bit of heather spray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now a mouthful of the grass.</span><br />
<br />
In the deeper sunniness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the place where nothing stirs,</span><br />
Quietly in quietness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the quiet of the furze,</span><br />
For a time they come and lie<br />
Staring on the roving sky.<br />
<br />
If you approach they run away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They leap and stare, away they bound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With a sudden angry sound,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
To the sunny quietude;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Crouching down where nothing stirs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the silence of the furze,</span><br />
Crouching down again to brood<br />
In the sunny solitude.<br />
<br />
If I were as wise as they<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I would stray apart and brood,</span><br />
I would beat a hidden way<br />
Through the quiet heather spray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To a sunny solitude;</span><br />
And should you come I'd run away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I would make an angry sound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I would stare and turn and bound</span><br />
To the deeper quietude,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the place where nothing stirs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the silence of the furze.</span><br />
<br />
In that airy quietness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I would think as long as they;</span><br />
Through the quiet sunniness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I would stray away to brood</span><br />
By a hidden beaten way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In a sunny solitude.</span><br />
<br />
I would think until I found<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Something I can never find,</span><br />
Something lying on the ground,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the bottom of my mind.</span><br />

THE FIFTEEN ACRES<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I cling and swing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On a branch, or sing</span><br />
Through the cool, clear hush of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Morning, O:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or fling my wing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the air, and bring</span><br />
To sleepier birds a warning, O:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That the night's in flight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the sun's in sight,</span><br />
And the dew is the grass adorning, O:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the green leaves swing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As I sing, sing, sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Up by the river,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Down the dell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To the little wee nest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Where the big tree fell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So early in the morning, O.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I flit and twit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the sun for a bit</span><br />
When his light so bright is shining, O:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or sit and fit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My plumes, or knit</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
Straw plaits for the nest's nice lining, O<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And she with glee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shows unto me</span><br />
Underneath her wings reclining, O:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I sing that Peg</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Has an egg, egg, egg,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Up by the oat-field,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Round the mill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Past the meadow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Down the hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So early in the morning, O.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I stoop and swoop</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the air, or loop</span><br />
Through the trees, and then go soaring, O:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To group with a troop</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the gusty poop</span><br />
While the wind behind is roaring, O:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I skim and swim</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By a cloud's red rim</span><br />
And up to the azure flooring, O:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And my wide wings drip</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As I slip, slip, slip</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Down through the rain-drops,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Back where Peg</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Broods in the nest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">On the little white egg</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So early in the morning, O.</span><br />

HOME THOUGHTS IN LAVENTIE<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Green gardens in Laventie!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Soldiers only know the street</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the mud is churned and splashed about</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By battle-wending feet;</span><br />
And yet beside one stricken house there is a glimpse of grass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Look for it when you pass.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the Church whose pitted spire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seems balanced on a strand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of swaying stone and tottering brick</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Two roofless ruins stand,</span><br />
And here behind the wreckage where the <i>back</i> wall should have been<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We found a garden green.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The grass was never trodden on,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The little path of gravel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was overgrown with celandine,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No other folk did travel</span><br />
Along its weedy surface, but the nimble-footed mouse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Running from house to house.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So all among the vivid blades</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of soft and tender grass</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We lay, nor heard the limber wheels</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That pass and ever pass,</span><br />
In noisy continuity until their stony rattle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seems in itself a battle.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At length we rose up from this ease</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of tranquil happy mind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And searched the garden's little length</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A fresh pleasaunce to find;</span><br />
And there, some yellow daffodils and jasmine hanging high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Did rest the tired eye.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fairest and most fragrant</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the many sweets we found,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was a little bush of Daphne flower</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon a grassy mound,</span><br />
And so thick were the blossoms set and so divine the scent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That we were well content.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hungry for Spring I bent my head,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The perfume fanned my face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all my soul was dancing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In that lovely little place,</span><br />
Dancing with a measured step from wrecked and shattered towns<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Away......upon the Downs.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw green banks of daffodil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Slim poplars in the breeze,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Great tan-brown hares in gusty March</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A-couching on the leas;</span><br />
And meadows with their glittering streams, and silver scurrying dace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Home&mdash;what a perfect place.</span><br />

ASPENS<br />
<br />
<br />
All day and night, save winter, every weather,<br />
Above the inn, the smithy, and the shop,<br />
The aspens at the cross-roads talk together<br />
Of rain, until their last leaves fall from the top.<br />
<br />
Out of the blacksmith's cavern comes the ringing<br />
Of hammer, shoe, and anvil; out of the inn<br />
The clink, the hum, the roar, the random singing&mdash;The<br />
sounds that for these fifty years have been.<br />
<br />
The whisper of the aspens is not drowned,<br />
And over lightless pane and footless road,<br />
Empty as sky, with every other sound<br />
Not ceasing, calls their ghosts from their abode.<br />
<br />
A silent smithy, a silent inn, not fails<br />
In the bare moonlight or the thick-furred gloom,<br />
In tempest or the night of nightingales,<br />
To turn the cross-roads to a ghostly room.<br />
<br />
And it would be the same were no house near.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
Over all sorts of weather, men, and times,<br />
A spens must shake their leaves and men may hear<br />
But need not listen, more than to my rhymes.<br />
<br />
Whatever wind blows, while they and I have leaves<br />
We cannot other than an aspen be<br />
That ceaselessly, unreasonably grieves,<br />
Or so men think who like a different tree.<br />
<br />

THE BROOK<br />
<br />
<br />
Seated once by a brook, watching a child<br />
Chiefly that paddled, I was thus beguiled.<br />
Mellow the blackbird sang and sharp the thrush<br />
Not far off in the oak and hazel brush,<br />
Unseen. There was a scent like honeycomb<br />
From mugwort dull. And down upon the dome<br />
Of the stone the cart-horse kicks against so oft<br />
A butterfly alighted. From aloft<br />
He took the heat of the sun, and from below,<br />
On the hot stone he perched contented so,<br />
As if never a cart would pass again<br />
That way; as if I were the last of men<br />
And he the first of insects to have earth<br />
And sun together and to know their worth,<br />
I was divided between him and the gleam,<br />
The motion, and the voices, of the stream,<br />
The waters running frizzled over gravel,<br />
That never vanish and for ever travel.<br />
A grey flycatcher silent on a fence<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
And I sat as if we had been there since<br />
The horseman and the horse lying beneath<br />
The fir-tree-covered barrow on the heath,<br />
The horseman and the horse with silver shoes,<br />
Galloped the downs last. All that I could lose<br />
I lost. And then the child's voice raised the dead.<br />
"No one's been here before" was what she said<br />
And what I felt, yet never should have found<br />
A word for, while I gathered sight and sound.<br />
<br />

THE BRIDGE<br />
<br />
<br />
I have come a long way to-day:<br />
On a strange bridge alone,<br />
Remembering friends, old friends,<br />
I rest, without smile or moan,<br />
As they remember me without smile or moan.<br />
<br />
All are behind, the kind<br />
And the unkind too, no more<br />
To-night than a dream. The stream<br />
Runs softly yet drowns the Past,<br />
The dark-lit stream has drowned the Future and the Past.<br />
<br />
No traveller has rest more blest<br />
Than this moment brief between<br />
Two lives, when the Night's first lights<br />
And shades hide what has never been,<br />
Things goodlier, lovelier, dearer, than will be or have been.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
LIGHTS OUT<br />
<br />
<br />
I have come to the borders of sleep,<br />
The unfathomable deep<br />
Forest where all must lose<br />
Their way, however straight,<br />
Or winding, soon or late;<br />
They cannot choose.<br />
<br />
Many a road and track<br />
That, since the dawn's first crack,<br />
Up to the forest brink,<br />
Deceived the travellers<br />
Suddenly now blurs,<br />
And in they sink.<br />
<br />
Here love ends,<br />
Despair, ambition ends,<br />
All pleasure and all trouble,<br />
Although most sweet or bitter,<br />
Here ends in sleep that is sweeter<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
Than tasks most noble.<br />
<br />
There is not any book<br />
Or face of dearest look<br />
That I would not turn from now<br />
To go into the unknown<br />
I must enter and leave alone<br />
I know not how.<br />
<br />
The tall forest towers;<br />
Its cloudy foliage lowers<br />
Ahead, shelf above shelf;<br />
Its silence I hear and obey<br />
That I may lose my way<br />
And myself.<br />
<br />
<br />

WORDS<br />
<br />
<br />
Out of us all<br />
That make rhymes,<br />
Will you choose<br />
Sometimes&mdash;<br />
As the winds use<br />
A crack in the wall<br />
Or a drain,<br />
Their joy or their pain<br />
To whistle through&mdash;<br />
Choose me,<br />
You English words?<br />
<br />
I know you:<br />
You are light as dreams,<br />
Tough as oak,<br />
Precious as gold,<br />
As poppies and corn,<br />
Or an old cloak:<br />
Sweet as our birds<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
To the ear,<br />
As the linnet note<br />
In the heat<br />
Of Midsummer:<br />
Strange as the races<br />
Of dead and unborn:<br />
Strange and sweet<br />
Equally.<br />
And familiar,<br />
To the eye,<br />
As the dearest faces<br />
That a man knows,<br />
And as lost homes are:<br />
But though older far<br />
Than oldest yew,&mdash;<br />
As our hills are, old,&mdash;<br />
Worn new<br />
Again and again:<br />
Young as our streams<br />
After rain:<br />
And as dear<br />
As the earth which you prove<br />
That we love.<br />
<br />
Make me content<br />
With some sweetness<br />
From Wales<br />
Whose nightingales<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
Have no wings,&mdash;<br />
From Wiltshire and Kent<br />
And Herefordshire,<br />
And the villages there,&mdash;<br />
From the names, and the things,<br />
No less.<br />
Let me sometimes dance<br />
With you,<br />
Or climb<br />
Or stand perchance<br />
In ecstasy,<br />
Fixed and free<br />
In a rhyme,<br />
As poets do.<br />
<br />

TALL NETTLES<br />
<br />
<br />
Tall nettles cover up, as they have done<br />
These many springs, the rusty harrow, the plough<br />
Long worn out, and the roller made of stone:<br />
Only the elm butt tops the nettles now.<br />
<br />
This corner of the farmyard I like most:<br />
As well as any bloom upon a flower<br />
I like the dust on the nettles, never lost<br />
Except to prove the sweetness of a shower.<br />

THE PATH<br />
<br />
<br />
Running along a bank, a parapet<br />
That saves from the precipitous wood below<br />
The level road, there is a path. It serves<br />
Children for looking down the long smooth steep,<br />
Between the legs of beech and yew, to where<br />
A fallen tree checks the sight: while men and women<br />
Content themselves with the road, and what they see<br />
Over the bank, and what the children tell.<br />
The path, winding like silver, trickles on,<br />
Bordered and ever invaded by thinnest moss<br />
That tries to cover roots and crumbling chalk<br />
With gold, olive, and emerald, but in vain.<br />
The children wear it. They have flattened the bank<br />
On top, and silvered it between the moss<br />
With the current of their feet, year after year.<br />
But the road is houseless, and leads not to school.<br />
To see a child is rare there, and the eye<br />
Has but the road, the wood that overhangs<br />
And underyawns it, and the path that looks<br />
As if it led on to some legendary<br />
Or fancied place where men have wished to go<br />
And stay; till, sudden, it ends where the wood ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
SWEDES<br />
<br />
<br />
They have taken the gable from the roof of clay<br />
On the long swede pile. They have let in the sun<br />
To the white and gold and purple of curled fronds<br />
Unsunned. It is a sight more tender-gorgeous<br />
At the wood-corner where Winter moans and drips<br />
Than when, in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings,<br />
A boy crawls down into a Pharaoh's tomb<br />
And, first of Christian men, beholds the mummy,<br />
God and monkey, chariot and throne and vase,<br />
Blue pottery, alabaster, and gold.<br />
<br />
But dreamless long-dead Amen-hotep lies.<br />
This is a dream of Winter, sweet as Spring.<br />

ROMANCE<br />
<br />
<br />
When I was but thirteen or so<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I went into a golden land,</span><br />
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Took me by the hand.</span><br />
<br />
My father died, my brother too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They passed like fleeting dreams.</span><br />
I stood where Popocatapetl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the sunlight gleams.</span><br />
<br />
I dimly heard the Master's voice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And boys far-off at play,</span><br />
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had stolen me away.</span><br />
<br />
I walked in a great golden dream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To and fro from school&mdash;</span><br />
Shining Popocatapetl<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dusty streets did rule.</span><br />
<br />
I walked home with a gold dark boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never a word I'd say,</span><br />
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had taken my speech away:</span><br />
<br />
I gazed entranced upon his face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fairer than any flower&mdash;</span><br />
O shining Popocatapetl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was thy magic hour:</span><br />
<br />
The houses, people, traffic seemed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thin fading dreams by day,</span><br />
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They had stolen my soul away!</span><br />

THE CAVES OF AUVERGNE<br />
<br />
<br />
He carved the red deer and the bull<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the smooth cave rock,</span><br />
Returned from war with belly full,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scarred with many a knock,</span><br />
He carved the red deer and the bull<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the smooth cave rock.</span><br />
<br />
The stars flew by the cave's wide door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clouds wild trumpets blew,</span><br />
Trees rose in wild dreams from the floor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flowers with dream faces grew</span><br />
Up to the sky, and softly hung<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Golden and white and blue.</span><br />
<br />
The woman ground her heap of corn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her heart a guarded fire;</span><br />
The wind played in his trembling soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a hand upon a lyre,</span><br />
The wind drew faintly on the stone<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Symbols of his desire:</span><br />
<br />
The red deer of the forest dark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose antlers cut the sky,</span><br />
That vanishes into the mirk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And like a dream flits by,</span><br />
And by an arrow slain at last<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is but the wind's dark body.</span><br />
<br />
The bull that stands in marshy lakes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As motionless and still</span><br />
As a dark rock jutting from a plain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without a tree or hill;</span><br />
The bull that is the sign of life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its sombre, phallic will.</span><br />
<br />
And from the dead, white eyes of them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wind springs up anew,</span><br />
It blows upon the trembling heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bull and deer renew</span><br />
Their flitting life in the dim past<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When that dead Hunter drew.</span><br />
<br />
I sit beside him in the night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, fingering his red stone,</span><br />
I chase through endless forests dark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seeking that thing unknown,</span><br />
That which is not red deer or bull,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But which by them was shown:</span><br />
<br />
By those stiff shapes in which he drew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His soul's exalted cry,</span><br />
When flying down the forest dark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He slew and knew not why,</span><br />
When he was filled with song, and strength<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flowed to him from the sky.</span><br />
<br />
The wind blows from red deer and bull,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clouds wild trumpets blare.</span><br />
Trees rise in wild dreams from the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flowers with dream faces stare,</span><br />
<i>O Hunter, your own shadow stands</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Within your forest lair!</i></span><br />

ECSTASY<br />
<br />
<br />
I saw a frieze on whitest marble drawn<br />
Of boys who sought for shells along the shore,<br />
Their white feet shedding pallor in the sea,<br />
The shallow sea, the spring-time sea of green<br />
That faintly creamed against the cold, smooth pebbles.<br />
<br />
The air was thin, their limbs were delicate,<br />
The wind had graven their small eager hands<br />
To feel the forests and the dark nights of Asia<br />
Behind the purple bloom of the horizon,<br />
Where sails would float and slowly melt away.<br />
<br />
Their naked, pure, and grave, unbroken silence<br />
Filled the soft air as gleaming, limpid water<br />
Fills a spring sky those days when rain is lying<br />
In shattered bright pools on the wind-dried roads,<br />
And their sweet bodies were wind-purified.<br />
<br />
One held a shell unto his shell-like ear<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
And there was music carven in his face,<br />
His eyes half-closed, his lips just breaking open<br />
To catch the lulling, mazy, coralline roar<br />
Of numberless caverns filled with singing seas.<br />
<br />
And all of them were hearkening as to singing<br />
Of far off voices thin and delicate,<br />
Voices too fine for any mortal mind<br />
To blow into the whorls of mortal ears&mdash;<br />
And yet those sounds flowed from their grave, sweet faces.<br />
<br />
And as I looked I heard that delicate music,<br />
And I became as grave, as calm, as still<br />
As those carved boys. I stood upon that shore,<br />
I felt the cool sea dream around my feet,<br />
My eyes were staring at the far horizon:<br />
<br />
And the wind came and purified my limbs,<br />
And the stars came and set within my eyes,<br />
And snowy clouds rested upon my shoulders,<br />
And the blue sky shimmered deep within me,<br />
And I sang like a carven pipe of music.<br />

KENT IN WAR<br />
<br />
<br />
The pebbly brook is cold to-night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its water soft as air,</span><br />
A clear, cold, crystal-bodied wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shadowless and bare,</span><br />
Leaping and running in this world<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where dark-horned cattle stare:</span><br />
<br />
Where dark-horned cattle stare, hoof-firm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the dark pavements of the sky,</span><br />
And trees are mummies swathed in sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And small dark hills crowd wearily:</span><br />
Soft multitudes of snow-grey clouds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without a sound march by.</span><br />
<br />
Down at the bottom of the road<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I smell the woody damp</span><br />
Of that cold spirit in the grass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leave my hill-top camp&mdash;</span><br />
Its long gun pointing in the sky&mdash;And<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">take the Moon for lamp.</span><br />
<br />
I stop beside the bright cold glint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that thin spirit of the grass,</span><br />
So gay it is, so innocent!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I watch its sparkling footsteps pass</span><br />
Lightly from smooth round stone to stone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hid in the dew-hung grass.</span><br />
<br />
My lamp shines in the globes of dew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leaps into that crystal wind</span><br />
Running along the shaken grass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To each dark hole that it can find&mdash;</span><br />
The crystal wind, the Moon my lamp,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have vanished in a wood that's blind.</span><br />
<br />
High lies my small, my shadowy camp,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crowded about by small dark hills;</span><br />
With sudden small white flowers the sky<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the woods' dark greenness fills;</span><br />
And hosts of dark-browed, muttering trees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In trance the white Moon stills.</span><br />
<br />
I move among their tall grey forms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thin moon-glimmering, wandering Ghost,</span><br />
Who takes his lantern through the world<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In search of life that he has lost,</span><br />
While watching by that long lean gun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon his small hill post.</span><br />

DEATH<br />
<br />
<br />
When I am dead a few poor souls shall grieve<br />
As I grieved for my brother long ago.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scarce did my eyes grow dim,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I had forgotten him;</span><br />
I was far-off hearing the spring winds blow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many summers burned</span><br />
When, though still reeling with my eyes aflame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I heard that faded name</span><br />
Whispered one Spring amid the hurrying world<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From which, years gone, he turned.</span><br />
<br />
I looked up at my windows and I saw<br />
The trees, thin spectres sucked forth by the moon.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The air was very still</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above a distant hill;</span><br />
It was the hour of night's full silver moon.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O art thou there my brother?" my soul cried;</span><br />
And all the pale stars down bright rivers wept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As my heart sadly crept</span><br />
About the empty hills, bathed in that light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lapped him when he died.</span><br />
<br />
Ah! it was cold, so cold; do I not know<br />
How dead my heart on that remembered day!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clear in a far-away place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see his delicate face</span><br />
Just as he called me from my solitary play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Giving into my hands a tiny tree.</span><br />
We planted it in the dark, blossomless ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gravely, without a sound;</span><br />
Then back I went and left him standing by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His birthday gift to me.</span><br />
<br />
In that far land perchance it quietly grows<br />
Drinking the rain, making a pleasant shade;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Birds in its branches fly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of the fathomless sky</span><br />
Where worlds of circling light arise and fade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Blindly it quivers in the bright flood of day,</span><br />
Or drowned in multitudinous shouts of rain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glooms o'er the dark-veiled plain&mdash;Buried</span><br />
below, the ghost that's in his bones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dreams in the sodden clay.</span><br />
<br />
And, while he faded, drunk with beauty's eyes<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
I kissed bright girls and laughed deep in dumb trees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That stared fixt in the air</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like madmen in despair</span><br />
Gaped up from earth with the escaping breeze.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw earth's exaltation slowly creep</span><br />
Out of their myriad sky-embracing veins.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I laughed along the lanes,</span><br />
Meeting Death riding in from the hollow seas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through black-wreathed woods asleep.</span><br />
<br />
I laughed, I swaggered on the cold, hard ground<br />
Through the grey air trembled a falling wave&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thou'rt pale, O Death!" I cried,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mocking him in my pride;</span><br />
And passing I dreamed not of that lonely grave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But of leaf-maidens whose pale, moon-like hands</span><br />
Above the tree-foam waved in the icy air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweeping with shining hair</span><br />
Through the green-tinted sky, one moment fled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of immortal lands.</span><br />
<br />
One windless Autumn night the Moon came out<br />
In a white sea of cloud, a field of snow;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In darkness shaped of trees,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I sank upon my knees</span><br />
And watched her shining, from the small wood below&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faintly Death flickered in an owl's far cry&mdash;</span><br />
We floated soundless in the great gulf of space,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her light upon my face&mdash;Immortal,</span><br />
shining in that dark wood I knelt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And knew I could not die.</span><br />
<br />
And knew I could not die&mdash;O Death did'st thou<br />
Heed my vain glory, standing pale by thy dead?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is a spirit who grieves</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid earth's dying leaves;</span><br />
Was't thou that wept beside my brother's bed?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I did never mourn nor heed at all</span><br />
Him passing on his temporal elm-wood bier;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I never shed a tear.</span><br />
The drooping sky spread grey-winged through my soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While stones and earth did fall.</span><br />
<br />
That sound rings down the years&mdash;I hear it yet&mdash;<br />
All earthly life's a winding funeral&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And though I never wept,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But into the dark coach stept,</span><br />
Dreaming by night to answer the blood's sweet call,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She who stood there, high breasted, with small wise lips,</span><br />
And gave me wine to drink and bread to eat,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has not more steadfast feet,</span><br />
But fades from my arms as fade from mariners' eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sea's most beauteous ships.</span><br />
<br />
The trees and hills of earth were once as close<br />
As my own brother, they are becoming dreams<br />
And shadows in my eyes;<br />
More dimly lies<br />
Guaya deep in my soul, the coastline gleams<br />
Faintly along the darkening crystalline seas.<br />
Glimmering and lovely still, 'twill one day go;<br />
The surging dark will flow<br />
Over my hopes and joys, and blot out all<br />
Earth's hills and skies and trees.<br />
<br />
I shall look up one night and see the Moon<br />
For the last time shining above the hills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thou, silent, wilt ride</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the dark hillside.</span><br />
'Twill be, perchance, the time of daffodils&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>"How come those bright immortals in the woods?</i></span><br />
<i>Their joy being young, did'st thou not drag them all</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Into dark graves ere Fall?"</i></span><br />
Shall life thus haunt me, wondering, as I go<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To thy deep solitudes?</span><br />
<br />
There is a figure with a down-turned torch<br />
Carved on a pillar in an olden time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A calm and lovely boy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who comes not to destroy</span><br />
But to lead age back to its golden prime.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus did an antique sculptor draw thee, Death,</span><br />
With smooth and beauteous brow and faint sweet smile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor haggard, gaunt and vile,</span><br />
And thou perhaps art Him to whom men may<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unvexed, give up their breath.</span><br />
<br />
But in my soul thou sittest like a dream<br />
Among earth's mountains, by her dim-coloured seas;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A wild unearthly Shape</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In thy dark-glimmering cape,</span><br />
Piping a tune of wavering melodies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou sittest, ay, thou sittest at the feast</span><br />
Of my brief life among earth's bright-wreathed flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stemming the dancing hours</span><br />
With sombre gleams until abrupt, thou risest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all, at once, is ceased.</span><br />

SOLDIERS IN A SMALL CAMP<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a camp upon a rounded hill<br />
Where men do sleep more closely to the stars,<br />
And tree-like shapes stand at its entrances,<br />
Beside the small, dark, shadow-soldiery.<br />
<br />
Deep in the gloom of days of isolation,<br />
Withdrawn, high up from the low, murmuring town,<br />
Those shadows sit, drooping around their fires,<br />
Or move as winds dark-waving in a wood.<br />
<br />
Staring at cattle on a neighbouring hill<br />
They are oblivious as is stone or grass&mdash;The<br />
clouds passed voiceless over, and the sun<br />
Rose, and lit trees, and vanished utterly.<br />
<br />
Then in the awful beauty of the world,<br />
When stars are singing in dark ecstasy,<br />
Those ox-like soldiers sit collected round<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
A thin, metallic echo of human song:<br />
<br />
And click their feet and clap their hands in time,<br />
And wag their heads, and make the white ghost owl<br />
Flit from its branch&mdash;but still those tree-like shapes<br />
Stand like archangels dark-winged in the sky.<br />
<br />
And presently the soldiers cease to stir;<br />
The thin voice sinks and all at once is dead;<br />
They lie down on their planks and hear the wind,<br />
And feel the darkness fumbling at their souls.<br />
<br />
They lie in rows as stiff as tombs or trees,<br />
Their eyeballs imageless, like marble still;<br />
And secretly they feel that roof and walls<br />
Are gone and that they stare into the sky.<br />
<br />
It is so black, so black, so black, so black,<br />
Those black-winged shapes have stretched across the world,<br />
Have swallowed up the stars, and if the sun<br />
Rises again, it will be black, black, black.<br />
<br />

A RITUAL DANCE<br />
<br />
<br />
I&mdash;THE DANCE<br />
<br />
<br />
In the black glitter of night the grey vapour forest<br />
Lies a dark Ghost in the water, motionless, dark,<br />
Like a corpse by the bank fallen, and hopelessly rotting<br />
Where the thin silver soul of the stars silently dances.<br />
<br />
The flowers are closed, the birds are carved on the trees,<br />
When out of the forest glide hundreds of spear-holding shadows,<br />
In smooth dark ivory bodies their eyeballs gleaming<br />
Forming a gesturing circle beneath the Moon.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
The bright-eyed shadows, the tribe in ritual gathered,<br />
Are dancing and howling, the embryo soul of a nation:<br />
In loud drum-beating monotonous the tightly stretched skins<br />
Of oxen that stared at the stars are singing wild paeans:<br />
<br />
Wild paeans for food that magically grew in the clearings<br />
When he that was slain was buried and is resurrected,<br />
And a green mist arose from the mud and shone in the Moon,<br />
A great delirium of faces, a new generation.<br />
<br />
The thin wafer Moon it is there, it is there in the sky,<br />
The hand-linked circle raise faces of mad exaltation&mdash;<br />
Dance, O you Hunters, leap madly upon the flung shields,<br />
Shoot arrows into the sky, thin moon-seeking needles:<br />
<br />
Now you shall have a harvest, a belly-full rapture,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
There shall be many fat women, full grown, and smoother than honey,<br />
Their limbs like ivory rounded, and firm as a berry,<br />
Their lips full of food and their eyes full of hunger for men!<br />
<br />
The heat of the earth arises, a faint love mist<br />
Wan with over-desiring, and in the marshes<br />
Blindly the mud stirs, clouding the dark shining water,<br />
And troubling the still soft swarms of fallen stars.<br />
<br />
There is bright sweat upon the bodies of cattle,<br />
Great vials of life motionless in the moonlight,<br />
Breathing faint mists over the warm, damp ground;<br />
And the cry of a dancer rings through the shadowy forest.<br />
<br />
The tiger is seeking his mate and his glassy eyes<br />
Are purple and shot with starlight in the grass shining,<br />
The fiery grass tortured out of the mud and writhing<br />
Under the sun, now shivering and pale in the Moon.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
The shadows are dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing:<br />
The grey vapour amis of the forest lie dreaming around them;<br />
The cold, shining moonlight falls from their bodies and faces,<br />
But caught in their eyes lies prisoned and faintly gleaming:<br />
<br />
And they return to their dwellings within the grey forest,<br />
Into their dark huts, burying the moonlight with them,<br />
Burying the trees and the stars and the flowing river,<br />
And the glittering spears, and their dark, evocative gestures.<br />
<br />
<br />
II&mdash;SLEEP<br />
<br />
Hollow the world in the moonlit hour when the birds are shadows small,<br />
Lost in the swarm of giant leaves and myriad branches tall;<br />
When vast thick boughs hang across the sky like solid limbs of night,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
Dug from still quarries of grey-black air by the pale transparent light,<br />
And the purple and golden blooms of the sun, each crimson and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">spotted flower,</span><br />
Are folded up or have faded away, as the still intangible power<br />
Floats out of the sky, falls shimmering down, a silver-shadowy bloom,<br />
On the spear-pointed forest a fragile crown, in the soul a soft,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">bright gloom;</span><br />
Hollow the world when the shadow of man lies prone and still on its floor,<br />
And the moonlight shut from his empty heart weeps softly against his door,<br />
And his terror and joy but a little dream in the corner of his house,<br />
And his voice dead in the darkness 'mid the twittering of a mouse.<br />
<br />
<br />
III.<br />
<br />
Hollow the world! hollow the world!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And its dancers shadow-grey;</span><br />
And the Moon a silver-shadowy bloom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fading and fading away;</span><br />
And the forest's grey vapour, and all the trees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shadows against the sky;</span><br />
And the soul of man and his ecstasies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A night-forgotten cry.</span><br />
Hollow the world! hollow the world!<br />

FROM A FLEMISH GRAVEYARD<br />
<br />
JANUARY 1915<br />
<br />
<br />
A year hence may the grass that waves<br />
O'er English men in Flemish graves,<br />
Coating this clay with green of peace<br />
And softness of a year's increase,<br />
Be kind and lithe as English grass<br />
To bend and nod as the winds pass;<br />
It was for grass on English hills<br />
These bore too soon the last of ills.<br />
<br />
And may the wind be brisk and clean,<br />
And singing cheerfully between<br />
The bents a pleasant-burdened song<br />
To cheer these English dead along;<br />
For English songs and English winds<br />
Are they that bred these English minds.<br />
<br />
And may the circumstantial trees<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
Dip, for these dead ones, in the breeze,<br />
And make for them their silver play<br />
Of spangled boughs each shiny day.<br />
Thus may these look above, and see<br />
And hear the wind in grass and tree,<br />
And watch a lark in heaven stand,<br />
And think themselves in their own land.<br />

SONG OF THE DARK AGES<br />
<br />
<br />
We digged our trenches on the down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside old barrows, and the wet</span><br />
White chalk we shovelled from below;<br />
It lay like drifts of thawing snow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On parados and parapet;</span><br />
<br />
Until a pick neither struck flint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor split the yielding chalky soil,</span><br />
But only calcined human bone:<br />
Poor relic of that Age of Stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose ossuary was our spoil.</span><br />
<br />
Home we marched singing in the rain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the while, beneath our song,</span><br />
I mused how many springs should wane<br />
And still our trenches scar the plain:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The monument of an old wrong.</span><br />
<br />
But then, I thought, the fair green sod<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will wholly cover that white stain,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
And soften, as it clothes the face<br />
Of those old barrows, every trace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of violence to the patient plain.</span><br />
<br />
And careless people, passing by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will speak of both in casual tone:</span><br />
Saying: "You see the toil they made<br />
The age of iron, pick and spade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here jostles with the Age of Stone."</span><br />
<br />
Yet either from that happier race<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will merit but a passing glance;</span><br />
And they will leave us both alone:<br />
Poor savages who wrought in stone&mdash;Poor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor savages who fought in France.</span><br />

BÊTE HUMAINE<br />
<br />
<br />
Riding through Ruwu swamp, about sunrise,<br />
I saw the world awake; and as the ray<br />
Touched the tall grasses where they sleeping lay,<br />
Lo, the bright air alive with dragonflies:<br />
With brittle wings aquiver, and great eyes<br />
Piloting crimson bodies, slender and gay.<br />
I aimed at one, and struck it, and it lay<br />
Broken and lifeless, with fast-fading dyes ...<br />
Then my soul sickened with a sudden pain<br />
And horror, at my own careless cruelty,<br />
That in an idle moment I had slain<br />
A creature whose sweet life it is to fly:<br />
Like beasts that prey with tooth and claw ...<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nay, they</span><br />
Must slay to live, but what excuse had I?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
THE GIFT<br />
<br />
<br />
Marching on Tanga, marching the parch'd plain<br />
Of wavering spear-grass past Pangani river,<br />
England came to me&mdash;me who had always ta'en<br />
But never given before&mdash;England, the giver,<br />
In a vision of three poplar-trees that shiver<br />
On still evenings of summer, after rain,<br />
By Slapton Ley, where reed-beds start and quiver<br />
When scarce a ripple moves the upland grain.<br />
Then I thanked God that now I had suffered pain<br />
And, as the parch'd plain, thirst, and lain awake<br />
Shivering all night through till cold daybreak:<br />
In that I count these sufferings my gain<br />
And her acknowledgment. Nay, more, would fain<br />
Suffer as many more for her sweet sake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
THE LEANING ELM<br />
<br />
<br />
Before my window, in days of winter hoar<br />
Huddled a mournful wood;<br />
Smooth pillars of beech, domed chestnut, sycamore,<br />
In stony sleep they stood:<br />
But you, unhappy elm, the angry west<br />
Had chosen from the rest,<br />
Flung broken on your brothers' branches bare,<br />
And left you leaning there<br />
So dead that when the breath of winter cast<br />
Wild snow upon the blast,<br />
The other living branches, downward bowed,<br />
Shook free their crystal shroud<br />
And shed upon your blackened trunk beneath<br />
Their livery of death......<br />
<br />
On windless nights between the beechen bars<br />
I watched cold stars<br />
Throb whitely in the sky, and dreamily<br />
Wondered if any life lay locked in thee:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
If still the hidden sap secretly moved<br />
As water in the icy winterbourne<br />
Floweth unheard:<br />
And half I pitied you your trance forlorn:<br />
You could not hear, I thought, the voice of any bird,<br />
The shadowy cries of bats in dim twilight<br />
Or cool voices of owls crying by night ...<br />
Hunting by night under the horned moon:<br />
Yet half I envied you your wintry swoon,<br />
Till, on this morning mild, the sun, new-risen<br />
Steals from his misty prison;<br />
The frozen fallows glow, the black trees shaken<br />
In a clear flood of sunlight vibrating awaken:<br />
And lo, your ravaged hole, beyond belief<br />
Slenderly fledged anew with tender leaf<br />
As pale as those twin vanes that break at last<br />
In a tiny fan above the black beech-mast<br />
Where no blade springeth green<br />
But pallid bells of the shy helleborine.<br />
What is this ecstasy that overwhelms<br />
The dreaming earth? See, the embrownèd elms<br />
Crowding purple distances warm the depths of the wood:<br />
A new-born wind tosses their tassels brown,<br />
His white clouds dapple the down:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
Into a green flame bursting the hedgerows stand.<br />
<br />
Soon, with banners flying, Spring will walk the land....<br />
There is no day for thee, my soul, like this,<br />
No spring of lovely words. Nay, even the kiss<br />
Of mortal love that maketh man divine<br />
This light cannot outshine:<br />
Nay, even poets, they whose frail hands catch<br />
The shadow of vanishing beauty, may not match<br />
This leafy ecstasy. Sweet words may cull<br />
Such magical beauty as time may not destroy;<br />
But we, alas, are not more beautiful:<br />
We cannot flower in beauty as in joy.<br />
We sing, our mused words are sped, and then<br />
Poets are only men<br />
Who age, and toil, and sicken ... This maim'd tree<br />
May stand in leaf when I have ceased to be.<br />
<br />

PROTHALAMION<br />
<br />
<br />
When the evening came my love said to me:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let us go into the garden now that the sky is cool;</span><br />
The garden of black hellebore and rosemary<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where wild woodruff spills in a milky pool.</span><br />
<br />
Low we passed in the twilight, for the wavering heat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of day had waned; and round that shaded plot</span><br />
Of secret beauty the thickets clustered sweet:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here is heaven, our hearts whispered, but our lips spake not.</span><br />
<br />
Between that old garden and seas of lazy foam<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gloomy and beautiful alleys of trees arise</span><br />
With spire of cypress and dreamy beechen dome,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So dark that our enchanted sight knew nothing but the skies</span><br />
<br />
Veiled with a soft air, drench'd in the roses' musk<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or the dusky, dark carnation's breath of clove:</span><br />
No stars burned in their deeps, but through the dusk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw my love's eyes, and they were brimmed with love.</span><br />
<br />
No star their secret ravished, no wasting moon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mocked the sad transience of those eternal hours:</span><br />
Only the soft unseeing heaven of June,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ghosts of great trees, and the sleeping flowers.</span><br />
<br />
For doves that crooned in the leafy noonday now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were silent; the night-jar sought his secret covers,</span><br />
Nor even a mild sea-whisper moved a creaking bough&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was ever a silence deeper made for lovers?</span><br />
<br />
Was ever a moment meeter made for love?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beautiful are your close lips beneath my kiss;</span><br />
And all your yielding sweetness beautiful&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, never in all the world was such a night as this!</span><br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
